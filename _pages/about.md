is a comprehensive resource designed to integrate and synthesize knowledge about genes, with a particular focus on those that are understudied. By combining diverse datasets from trusted sources like `NCBI`, `EBI`, and others, this tool provides a streamlined approach to extracting insights from bibliometrics, genomics, and other biomedical data. Start now by searching for specific genes [here](/read-about-genes/genes/).

Our methodology emphasizes robust, reproducible data integration, with all filtering and processing steps openly shared to ensure transparency and facilitate collaboration. Our scripts to generate this work can be found in our [GitHub](https://github.com/tstoeger/read-about-genes) and the data compiled can be found in our [data](read-about-genes) page. By consolidating fragmented data and making it accessible, we hope this helps researchers learn more about genes that receive less research attention [add more here ].....
