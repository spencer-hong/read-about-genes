The [NLM MeSH](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov) (Medical Subject Headings) dataset is a comprehensive, hierarchically organized vocabulary developed and maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). It is used to index and catalog biomedical and health-related information, such as journal articles in PubMed, books, and other materials. MeSH is widely utilized by researchers, librarians, and developers to enhance the organization, retrieval, and analysis of biomedical information.
