The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [mitotic cytokinesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000281), [plasma membrane organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007009), and [cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007010). It enables functions such as [structural constituent of cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005200), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [cytoskeletal protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008092). The gene is located in multiple cellular components, including the [lysosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005764), [endoplasmic reticulum](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005783), [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), and [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829). It is also active in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and colocalizes with the [bicellular tight junction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005923). Additionally, the gene is involved in processes like [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165), [axonogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007409), and [neuromuscular junction development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007528), highlighting its multifaceted roles in cellular function and development.


The gene length is 14,657 base pairs (34.55% of all genes), the mature length is 879 base pairs (17.54% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 12,262 base pairs (38.75% of all genes).


The gene ANK3 (NCBI ID: 288) has been mentioned in [96 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ANK3%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1995 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2011 and 2017. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning ANK3, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Collaborative genome-wide association analysis supports a role for ANK3 and CACNA1C in bipolar disorder.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18711365)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 20.63), "[AnkyrinG is required for clustering of voltage-gated Na channels at axon initial segments and for normal action potential firing.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9832557)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 8.4), "[AnkyrinG. A new ankyrin gene with neural-specific isoforms localized at the axonal initial segment and node of Ranvier.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7836469)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 8.28), "[Nav1.5 E1053K mutation causing Brugada syndrome blocks binding to ankyrin-G and expression of Nav1.5 on the surface of cardiomyocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15579534)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 5.7), and "[Homozygous and heterozygous disruptions of ANK3: at the crossroads of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23390136)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 3.31). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ANK3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000151150-ANK3) is a gene implicated in various diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, cancer-related genes, and intellectual disability. Evidence for its involvement is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized to the plasma membrane. In terms of expression clusters, ANK3 is found in Cluster 24 for blood expression, Cluster 3 for tissue expression, Cluster 37 for brain expression, Cluster 64 for cell line expression, and Cluster 51 for single cell expression. Notably, ANK3 is associated with neurons and oligodendrocytes, suggesting a mixed function in the brain.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 6 experiments, [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) with 5 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 5 experiments, [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 5 experiments, and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including leukocyte disease, leukopenia, hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, and various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Neurological and mental health conditions are also represented, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. Furthermore, the data includes associations with substance-related disorders such as alcohol dependence and nicotine dependence, as well as developmental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Other notable conditions include bone disease, connective tissue disease, and sensory system disease.


The gene ANK3 has been associated with the trait [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36224396) through genome-wide association studies.


The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, nerve, and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in various regions of the brain, such as the Prefrontal Cortex, Cingulate Cortex, Medulla Oblongata, Parietal Lobe, and Pons.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including axon guidance, developmental biology, interaction between L1 and ankyrins, and L1CAM interactions.
