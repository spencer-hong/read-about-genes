[TYMS](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000176890-TYMS) is a gene with methyltransferase and transferase molecular functions. It is involved in various cancer-related processes and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is associated with cell proliferation in lymphoid tissue and bone marrow, as well as signal transduction in white matter. It is also expressed in various cell lines and single cells, with a notable role in cell proliferation.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [CHD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1105), [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are noted. The data also highlights hematopoietic and immune system diseases, as well as cardiovascular system disease. Furthermore, nervous system diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease, and mental health disorders such as substance dependence and alcohol dependence, are also represented.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including skin and blood. Additionally, it is expressed in 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, Leukemia_promyelocytic-HL-60 cells, CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, thymus, and Leukemialymphoblastic (MOLT-4) cells.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to cell cycle regulation, including G1/S transition, mitotic G1-G1/S phases, and cell cycle progression. Additionally, they participate in E2F-mediated regulation of DNA replication and G1/S-specific transcription. Metabolic processes are also prominent, with involvement in general metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and specifically pyrimidine biosynthesis and metabolism.
