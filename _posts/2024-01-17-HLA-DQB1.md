[HLA-DQB1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000179344-HLA-DQB1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus and rods & rings. The gene is expressed in dendritic cells with an unknown function (Cluster 2) and is involved in the immune response in lymphoid tissue (Cluster 70). In the brain, it shows non-specific expression with mixed function (Cluster 22). Additionally, it is expressed in lymphoma cell lines, contributing to the adaptive immune response (Cluster 21), and in single cells, it is involved in antigen presentation in dendritic cells (Cluster 28).
