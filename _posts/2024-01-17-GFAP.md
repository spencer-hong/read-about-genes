The gene length is 153,576 base pairs (89.26% of all genes), the mature length is 1,526 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 95,827 base pairs.


The gene GFAP (NCBI ID: 2670) has been mentioned in [1,091 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GFAP%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1972, and the middle 50% of publications range from 1993 to 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning GFAP, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include: ["Blood GFAP as an emerging biomarker in brain and spinal cord disorders."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35115728) (2022) (RCR: 40.44), ["Localization of the glial fibrillary acidic protein in astrocytes by immunofluorescence."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4559710) (1972) (RCR: 37.99), ["GFAP in health and disease."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21219963) (2011) (RCR: 21.95), ["Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein is elevated in cognitively normal older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33431793) (2021) (RCR: 20.95), and ["Glial fibrillary acidic protein: from intermediate filament assembly and gliosis to neurobiomarker."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25975510) (2015) (RCR: 19.64).

[GFAP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000131095-GFAP) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, known for its involvement in Leukodystrophy. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in intermediate filaments. GFAP is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 20 for non-specific DNA binding in blood, Cluster 9 for oligodendrocytes involved in myelination in tissues, Cluster 44 for mixed function in the brain, Cluster 72 for neuronal signal transduction in cell lines, and Cluster 47 for astrocytes with unknown function in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 5 experiments, [CNOT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4849) with 4 experiments, [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 4 experiments, and [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent detection in multiple experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including nervous system diseases, diseases of mental health, and substance-related disorders. Additionally, there are specific associations with eye and adnexa diseases, particularly eye diseases, sensory system diseases, retinal diseases, retinal degeneration, and glaucoma.


The genome-wide association study has identified a significant association between GFAP and [extensive white matter perivascular space burden](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37069360), which has been mapped to the closest existing MeSH term [White](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000095223) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various neural tissues, including the nerve, brain, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Prefrontal Cortex, Amygdala, Caudate nucleus, Hypothalamus, Spinal cord, Thalamus, and Olfactory Bulb, suggesting a ubiquitous expression in multiple neural tissue samples.


The proteins are involved in various pathways, including signaling by ERBB4, nuclear signaling by ERBB4, and signal transduction.
