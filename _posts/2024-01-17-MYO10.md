[MYO10](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000145555-MYO10) is a multifunctional protein with actin-binding, calmodulin-binding, motor protein, and myosin activities. It is detected in all tissues and is localized to the nucleoli rim, plasma membrane, and cytosol. MYO10 is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, playing a role in the innate immune response. It is also found in endocrine and neural tissues, neurons, skin cancer cell lines, and Müller glia cells, contributing to visual perception. Evidence for MYO10 is established at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 6 experiments, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 5 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 4 experiments, [SOX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6657) with 4 experiments, and [TRIM24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8805) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as viral infectious diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infectious disease. Additionally, there are associations with various types of cancer, including lung cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and other hematologic and immune system cancers. Respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are also implicated. Metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity, are noted. Cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and hypertension, are present, along with kidney and urinary system diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, as well as mental health disorders like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, are included. Other conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, iron metabolism disease, and gallbladder disease are also associated.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid, lung, and stomach, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the prefrontal cortex, retina, amygdala, whole brain, caudate nucleus, smooth muscle, and small intestine.


The input data highlights several key biological pathways, including those involved in the immune system, particularly the innate immune system, and developmental biology. Notably, axon guidance and netrin-1 signaling are crucial processes within developmental biology. Additionally, the data emphasizes fcgamma receptor (FCGR) dependent phagocytosis and the regulation of actin dynamics for phagocytic cup formation, both of which are integral to immune responses.


The mouse ortholog gene 17909 and its human ortholog gene 4651 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal coat/hair pigmentation, abnormal cornea morphology, abnormal digit morphology, abnormal lens morphology, cataract, cornea opacity, fused cornea and lens, and persistence of hyaloid vascular system. Additionally, fused phalanges are observed, although this trait is not present in both sexes.
