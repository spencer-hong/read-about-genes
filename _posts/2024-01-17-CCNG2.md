The gene is involved in the [regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000079) and is part of the [cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000307). It is active in both the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737). The gene enables [cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase regulator activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016538) and is involved in the [mitotic cell cycle phase transition](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0044772), [cell division](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051301), and the [regulation of cell cycle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051726).


The gene length is 34,737 base pairs (56.71% of all genes), the mature length is 3,156 base pairs (74.65% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 18,332 base pairs (49.39% of all genes).


The gene CCNG2 (NCBI ID: 901) has been mentioned in [50 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CCNG2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1996 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2013 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning CCNG2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Exosomal MicroRNA MiR-1246 Promotes Cell Proliferation, Invasion and Drug Resistance by Targeting CCNG2 in Breast Cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29216623)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 8.15), "[Cyclin G2 associates with protein phosphatase 2A catalytic and regulatory B' subunits in active complexes and induces nuclear aberrations and a G1/S phase cell cycle arrest.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11956189)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 2.77), "[METTL3 promotes the initiation and metastasis of ovarian cancer by inhibiting CCNG2 expression via promoting the maturation of pri-microRNA-1246.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34497267)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 2.73), "[miR-1246 Targets CCNG2 to Enhance Cancer Stemness and Chemoresistance in Oral Carcinomas.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30115848)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 2.63), and "[Cyclin G1 and cyclin G2 comprise a new family of cyclins with contrasting tissue-specific and cell cycle-regulated expression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8626390)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 2.41). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CCNG2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000138764-CCNG2) is a cyclin-related gene involved in cancer. Evidence at the protein level supports its molecular function. The gene is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. It is part of Cluster 22 in blood expression, specifically related to eosinophils and transcription. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 16, indicating non-specific transcription. Similarly, in brain expression, it is part of Cluster 15, also indicating non-specific transcription. In cell line expression, it is found in Cluster 22, associated with mRNA splicing and the cell cycle. Additionally, in single-cell expression, it is part of Cluster 17, related to breast glandular cells and lactation.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942) with 6 experiments, followed by [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [JUND](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3727), and [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733), each with 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in breast and prostate tissues according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), whole blood, fetal brain, cerebellum, cerebellum peduncles, bronchial epithelial cells, and prostate.
