The gene is involved in [liver development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001889) and [nitrogen compound metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006807). It enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [protein transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008320), and [signaling receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0038023). The gene is located in the [endoplasmic reticulum](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005783) and the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and is part of the [Sec62/Sec63 complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031207). Additionally, it is involved in various protein targeting processes, including [protein targeting to membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006612), [SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006614), and [post-translational protein targeting to endoplasmic reticulum membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006620), acting upstream of or within these processes. It also plays a role in [post-translational protein targeting to membrane, translocation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031204).


The gene length is 9,815 base pairs (25.33% of all genes), the mature length is 1,292 base pairs (31.72% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 7,022 base pairs (25.0% of all genes).


The gene SEC63, with NCBI ID 11231, has been mentioned in [17 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SEC63%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1999, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning SEC63, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mutations in SEC63 cause autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15133510)" (2004) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 3.5, "[Stepwise gating of the Sec61 protein-conducting channel by Sec63 and Sec62.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33398175)" (2021) with an RCR of 3.08, "[Different effects of Sec61Î±, Sec62 and Sec63 depletion on transport of polypeptides into the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22375059)" (2012) with an RCR of 2.91, "[Mammalian Sec61 is associated with Sec62 and Sec63.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10799540)" (2000) with an RCR of 2.4, and "[Identification of signal peptide features for substrate specificity in human Sec62/Sec63-dependent ER protein import.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32133789)" (2020) with an RCR of 1.97. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SEC63](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000025796-SEC63) is a gene that functions as a chaperone and is involved in disease variants. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is expressed in eosinophils with unknown function and is involved in protein processing in various tissues. In the brain, it is associated with nucleic acid binding, and in cell lines, it is involved in nuclear processes. Additionally, SEC63 is expressed in serous glandular cells, contributing to salivary secretion.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [NELFE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7936), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), and [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cancer, particularly lung cancer and its subtypes such as lung adenocarcinoma, lung carcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. Additionally, the data highlights diseases of cellular proliferation, organ system cancer, and respiratory system cancer. Furthermore, associations with nervous system diseases, refractive errors, myopia, and various eye diseases, including those affecting the eye and adnexa, are also noted.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including BDCA4+ dendritic cells, salivary gland, pancreas, pancreatic islet, and ovary.



The mouse gene with NCBI ID 140740 and its human ortholog with NCBI ID 11231 are associated with several phenotypic outcomes. Notably, the mouse gene is linked to embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis and embryonic lethality prior to the tooth bud stage, both of which are not observed in both sexes. Additionally, the gene is associated with preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which is observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.678 (19.09th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -22.52 (9.56th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.008 (75.05th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix (36.45%, 82.89th percentile) and sheet (34.34%, 54.42nd percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (25.66%, 26.36th percentile). The instability index is 50.60 (59.32nd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.21 (11.79th percentile). The protein is 760 amino acids long (78.78th percentile) with a molecular weight of 87995.88 Da (80.13th percentile).
