The gene enables [lipid transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005319) and [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524), and is involved in [lipid transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006869). It is located in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020) and is active in the [intracellular membrane-bounded organelle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043231). Additionally, it enables [ATP hydrolysis activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016887), [ATPase-coupled transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042626), and [ABC-type transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0140359), and is involved in [transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0055085).


The gene length is 248,863 base pairs (94.59% of all genes), the mature length is 2,382.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 43,730.5 base pairs.


The gene ABCA9, with NCBI ID 10350, has been mentioned in [1 publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ABCA9%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2002, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2002 and 2002.


The top publication mentioning ABCA9 is "[Molecular structure of a novel cholesterol-responsive A subclass ABC transporter, ABCA9.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150964)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 1.18). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ABCA9](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154258-ABCA9) is a translocase primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in smooth muscle tissue involved in ECM organization. In the brain, it shows non-specific expression with mixed functions. At the cellular level, ABCA9 is expressed in connective tissue cells and fibroblasts, both involved in ECM organization. Evidence for this gene is supported at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 3 experiments, [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725) with 2 experiments, and [HNF1B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6928) with 2 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, kidney disease, urinary system disease, nervous system disease, central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, motor neuron disease, sensory system disease, and cerebrovascular disease.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including adipose tissue, breast, nerve, and ovary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the salivary gland and ovary.


The input data highlights the involvement of ABC-family proteins in various transport processes. Specifically, these proteins mediate the transport of small molecules across membranes and play a crucial role in lipid homeostasis through ABCA transporters.



The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.087 (87.51% percentile), indicating a slightly hydrophobic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -6.51 (29.58% percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.992 (14.78% percentile), with a propensity for secondary structures as follows: 33.13% helix (60.35% percentile), 42.12% sheet (90.93% percentile), and 25.31% turn (23.74% percentile). The instability index is 36.35 (12.79% percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.49 (42.4% percentile). The protein is 1624 amino acids long (95.85% percentile) with a molecular weight of 184359.36 Da (96.06% percentile).
