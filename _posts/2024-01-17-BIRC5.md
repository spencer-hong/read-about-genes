[BIRC5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000089685-BIRC5) is a gene with multiple molecular functions, including protease inhibitor, repressor, and thiol protease inhibitor. It is involved in cancer-related processes and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized to the cytokinetic bridge. Its expression is associated with cell proliferation in various clusters, including lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, white matter, and breast cancer cell lines.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [KDM2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/84678), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates a wide range of disease conditions associated with GWAS, including various types of cancer such as lung cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory system diseases like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are highlighted. The data also encompasses hematopoietic and immune system diseases, as well as cardiovascular system diseases. Furthermore, mental health disorders, including substance-related disorders like alcohol and nicotine dependence, are noted. Gastrointestinal system diseases, specifically periodontitis and periodontal disease, are also included in the dataset.


The gene BIRC5 has been associated with [Behavioural disinhibition (generation interaction)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23942779), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Impulsive Behavior](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007175) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including cardiac myocytes, B lymphoblasts, Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi), CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, thymus, and lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4). Additionally, it is expressed in blood.


The proteins are involved in various stages of the cell cycle, particularly focusing on mitotic processes. These include the broader mitotic phase, as well as specific stages such as mitotic anaphase, mitotic metaphase and anaphase, and mitotic prometaphase. Key processes within these stages include the separation of sister chromatids and the resolution of sister chromatid cohesion.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.749 (14.47th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -4.16 (35.97th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.011 (84.16th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (0.437, 97.51st percentile), with lower affinities for sheet (0.275, 16.19th percentile) and turn (0.225, 8.18th percentile) structures. The instability index is 50.02 (57.37th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.66 (21.98th percentile). The protein is 142 amino acids long (7.15th percentile) with a molecular weight of 16388.53 Da (7.59th percentile).
