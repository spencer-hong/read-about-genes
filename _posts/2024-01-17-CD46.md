The gene length is 6,783 base pairs (18.52% of all genes), the mature length is 626.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 4,614 base pairs.


The gene CD46 (NCBI ID: 4179) has been mentioned in [400 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CD46%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning CD46 is 1960, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2016.


The top 5 publications mentioning CD46, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human membrane cofactor protein (CD46) acts as a cellular receptor for measles virus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8371352)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 17.35), "[Genetics of HUS: the impact of MCP, CFH, and IF mutations on clinical presentation, response to treatment, and outcome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16621965)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 13.27), "[Chimeric 2C10R4 anti-CD40 antibody therapy is critical for long-term survival of GTKO.hCD46.hTBM pig-to-primate cardiac xenograft.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27045379)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 12.27), "[NASA-TLX Assessment of Surgeon Workload Variation Across Specialties.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30247331)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 11.95), and "[A feedback regulatory loop involving microRNA-9 and nuclear receptor TLX in neural stem cell fate determination.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19330006)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 9.25). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CD46](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000117335-CD46) functions as a host cell receptor for virus entry and is implicated in various diseases, including cancer-related genes and hemolytic uremic syndrome. Evidence supports its role at the protein level. CD46 is detected in all tissues and is primarily located in the plasma membrane. It is expressed in neutrophils, with notable expression in the parathyroid gland, choroid plexus, and stomach and colon cancer cell lines. Additionally, CD46 is involved in protein binding, vesicular transport, digestion, and degranulation processes.
