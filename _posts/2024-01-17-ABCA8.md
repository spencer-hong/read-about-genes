The gene ABCA8, with NCBI ID 10351, has been mentioned in [10 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ABCA8%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2002, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2013 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning ABCA8, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Catalog of 605 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 13 genes encoding human ATP-binding cassette transporters: ABCA4, ABCA7, ABCA8, ABCD1, ABCD3, ABCD4, ABCE1, ABCF1, ABCG1, ABCG2, ABCG4, ABCG5, and ABCG8.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12111378)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 2.17), "[ABCA8 Regulates Cholesterol Efflux and High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28882873)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.82), "[ABCA8 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation by regulating the AMP activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35191604)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 1.8), "[ABCA8-mediated efflux of taurocholic acid contributes to gemcitabine insensitivity in human pancreatic cancer via the S1PR2-ERK pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33431858)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.68), and "[ABCA8 is regulated by miR-374b-5p and inhibits proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma through the ERK/ZEB1 pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32430024)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.31). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[ABCA8](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141338-ABCA8) is a gene encoding a protein with translocase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. ABCA8 is notably expressed in smooth muscle tissue, where it is involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, and in white matter, where it plays a role in signal transduction. Additionally, the gene is expressed in connective tissue cells and fibroblasts, contributing to ECM organization. While ABCA8 is not prognostic for several cancer types, it has been studied in various contexts, including breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [GATA6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2627), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as breast cancer, thoracic cancer, male reproductive organ cancer, testicular cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, intestinal cancer, large intestine cancer, gastrointestinal system cancer, myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, colon cancer, and lung cancer. Additionally, the data highlights associations with infectious diseases like hand, foot and mouth disease, as well as metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular conditions including coronary artery disease. Mental health conditions, including cognitive disorder, mood disorder, and mental depression, are also represented. Furthermore, the data includes associations with inherited metabolic disorders, lipid storage diseases, and lysosomal storage diseases.


The gene ABCA8 has been associated with [Alzheimer disease and age of onset](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26830138) through genome-wide association studies.


The gene is expressed in various neural tissues, including the nerve, trigeminal ganglion, atrioventricular node, ciliary ganglion, dorsal root ganglion, and olfactory bulb. Additionally, it is expressed in the ovary.


The input data highlights two key pathways involving protein transport: ABC-family proteins mediated transport and transmembrane transport of small molecules.
