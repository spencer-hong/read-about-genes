The gene enables [magnesium ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000287) and [protein kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004672), including [protein serine/threonine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004674). It is involved in various biological processes such as [cell morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000902), [branching involved in blood vessel morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001569), [neural tube formation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001841), [endocardium development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003157), and [protein phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006468). The gene is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), and [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), and is active in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829). Additionally, it plays a role in [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165), [apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006915), and [central nervous system development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007417). The gene is also part of a [protein-containing complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032991) and is involved in various regulatory processes, including [positive regulation of protein phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001934) and [positive regulation of peptidyl-serine phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0033138).


The gene has a length of 9,384 base pairs (24.41% of all genes), a mature length of 2,456 base pairs, and a primary transcript length of 9,017 base pairs.


The gene STK4 (NCBI ID: 6789) has been mentioned in [40 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22STK4%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1998 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2015 and 2021. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning STK4, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The phenotype of human STK4 deficiency.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22294732)" (2012) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 5.57, "[Caspase-mediated activation and induction of apoptosis by the mammalian Ste20-like kinase Mst1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9545236)" (1998) with an RCR of 5.29, "[Regulation of the MST1 kinase by autophosphorylation, by the growth inhibitory proteins, RASSF1 and NORE1, and by Ras.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15109305)" (2004) with an RCR of 4.84, "[Phosphorylation of LC3 by the Hippo kinases STK3/STK4 is essential for autophagy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25544559)" (2015) with an RCR of 4.14, and "[MicroRNA-18a targeting of the STK4/MST1 tumour suppressor is necessary for transformation in HPV positive cervical cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32555725)" (2020) with an RCR of 3.05. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[STK4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000101109-STK4) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, functioning as a kinase. Evidence supports its existence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, nuclear bodies, and cytosol. STK4 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 35 in neutrophils related to protein binding, Cluster 70 in lymphoid tissue involved in immune response, Cluster 7 in the brain with non-specific ribosome function, Cluster 55 in lymphoma related to immune response, and Cluster 78 in NK-cells and T-cells associated with the immune system and transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019), [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313), and [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as integumentary system cancer, skin cancer, skin melanoma, organ system cancer, and nervous system cancer, with specific mentions of neuroblastoma and autonomic nervous system neoplasm. Additionally, the data highlights metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as kidney and urinary system diseases. Mental health conditions are also represented, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, mood disorder, psychotic disorder, and schizophrenia.


The gene STK4 has been associated with [Educational attainment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855049), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Educational Status](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004522) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung, blood, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in various cell types such as CD33+ Myeloid cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, as well as in tissues like the Superior Cervical Ganglion, Skeletal Muscle, Atrioventricular Node, and Ciliary Ganglion.


The proteins are involved in signal transduction, specifically in the signaling by hippo pathway.
