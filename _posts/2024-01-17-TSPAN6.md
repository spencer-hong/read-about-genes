The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is located in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020) and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). It is involved in the [negative regulation of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0039532), [positive regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043123), and [negative regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043124).


The gene length is 7,057 base pairs (19.09% of all genes), the mature length is 1,021 base pairs (23.26% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 4,178.5 base pairs (15.61% of all genes).


The gene TSPAN6 (NCBI ID: 7105) has been mentioned in [7 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TSPAN6%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2017 and 2021.


The top 5 publications mentioning TSPAN6 include "[Tetraspanin-6 negatively regulates exosome production.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32108028)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 3.43, "[Tetraspanin 6 is a regulator of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34521767)" (2021) with a relative citation ratio of 1.47, "[TSPAN6 is a suppressor of Ras-driven cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184157)" (2022) with a relative citation ratio of 0.65, "[Tetraspanin 6: A novel regulator of hippocampal synaptic transmission and long term plasticity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28207852)" (2017) with a relative citation ratio of 0.4, and "[Correction: Tetraspanin 6: A novel regulator of hippocampal synaptic transmission and long term plasticity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29065158)" (2017) with a relative citation ratio of 0.11. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TSPAN6](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000000003-TSPAN6) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and the protein is localized to the nucleoli fibrillar center, cell junctions, and cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 43 for blood expression related to transcription and translation, Cluster 8 for tissue expression related to cilium organization in ciliated cells, Cluster 3 for brain expression in the choroid plexus related to cilium, Cluster 53 for cell line expression in squamous epithelial cells related to keratinization, and Cluster 36 for single cell expression in late spermatids with an unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), and [SS18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6760), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.




The gene TSPAN6 has been associated with [thyroid stimulating hormone levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37872160), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Hormones](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006728) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, pituitary, and colon, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the salivary gland, trachea, colon, pituitary, kidney, fetal liver, olfactory bulb, and testis germ cells.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.359 (93.08th percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity. The protein exhibits a charge of 3.67 at pH 7.0 (63.4th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.981 (5.32nd percentile). The secondary structure affinities are notable, with 29.0% of residues tending to be in helices (23.34th percentile), 46.5% in sheets (95.89th percentile), and 22.4% in turns (7.85th percentile). The instability index is 23.45 (1.13rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.44 (65.39th percentile). The protein has a length of 245 amino acids (20.94th percentile) and a molecular weight of 27562.97 Da (21.26th percentile).
