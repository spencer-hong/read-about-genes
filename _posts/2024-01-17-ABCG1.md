The gene length is 79,916 base pairs (77.36% of all genes), the mature length is 1,254 base pairs (30.67% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 62,975 base pairs (80.31% of all genes).


The gene ABCG1 (NCBI ID: 9619) has been mentioned in [185 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ABCG1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1981, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2018.


The top five publications mentioning ABCG1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[ABCG1 has a critical role in mediating cholesterol efflux to HDL and preventing cellular lipid accumulation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16054053)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 13.59), "[ABCA1 and ABCG1 as potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of atherosclerosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35063134)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 13.05), "[Role of HDL, ABCA1, and ABCG1 transporters in cholesterol efflux and immune responses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19797709)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 12.72), "[ABCA1 and ABCG1 synergize to mediate cholesterol export to apoA-I.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16357317)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 7.27), and "[Deficiency of ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1 in macrophages increases inflammation and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23572498)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 6.47). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ABCG1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000160179-ABCG1) is a translocase with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and vesicles. ABCG1 is expressed in neutrophils with unknown function, the parathyroid gland involved in vesicular transport, oligodendrocytes with mixed function, leukemia T-cell receptor, and macrophages involved in innate immune response.

Cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and heart disease, are also included. Furthermore, the data covers nervous system diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, as well as cognitive disorders and diseases of mental health. Substance-related disorders, specifically alcohol dependence, are also mentioned. The data also includes primary immunodeficiency diseases, such as agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency, as well as specific lung carcinomas like non-small cell lung carcinoma.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the adrenal gland, lung, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the retina, lung, placenta, pancreatic islet, adrenal gland, thymus, and leukemia lymphoblastic (MOLT-4).


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to lipid metabolism and transport, including ABC-family proteins mediated transport, ABCA transporters in lipid homeostasis, lipid digestion, mobilization, and transport, lipoprotein metabolism, and HDL-mediated lipid transport. Additionally, they participate in broader metabolic processes and the transmembrane transport of small molecules.
