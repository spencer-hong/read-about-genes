The gene enables [serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004867) and is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576) and [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), where it is also active. Additionally, it is involved in the [negative regulation of endopeptidase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010951). The gene is also found in the [platelet dense granule lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031089) and the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062).


The gene length is 40,689.0 base pairs (60.78% of all genes), the mature length is 2,246.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 39,532.0 base pairs.


The gene SERPINA4 (NCBI Gene ID: 5267) has been mentioned in [109 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SERPINA4%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1989, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning SERPINA4, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Kallistatin: a novel human tissue kallikrein inhibitor. Purification, characterization, and reactive center sequence.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1334488)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 3.81), "[Kallistatin reduces vascular senescence and aging by regulating microRNA-34a-SIRT1 pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28544111)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 2.95), "[Kallistatin/Serpina3c inhibits cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction by regulating glycolysis via Nr4a1 activation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35577178)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 2.92), "[Plasma E-selectin and kallistatin as predictive markers of histologic chorioamnionitis in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35772987)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 2.74), and "[Kallistatin is a new inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12384424)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 2.67). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SERPINA4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100665-SERPINA4) is a gene encoding a protein with molecular functions as a protease inhibitor and serine protease inhibitor. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The RNA expression of SERPINA4 is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in the liver, where it is involved in metabolism. Subcellularly, the protein is localized to vesicles. In cell lines, SERPINA4 expression is clustered in liver cancer cells, also associated with metabolism. Single-cell expression data further indicate its presence in hepatocytes involved in metabolic processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [HNF1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6927) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [BMI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/648), and [HNF1B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6928) were each found to be regulating in 2 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various metabolic disorders, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, glucose metabolism diseases, diabetes mellitus, and specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the pancreas, liver, and stomach, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, liver, pancreas, pancreatic islet, pituitary, fetal liver, and ovary.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.069 (80.23rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 1.174 (54.63rd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.995 (21.21st percentile). The protein has a length of 427 amino acids (49.15th percentile) and a molecular weight of 48541.36 Da (50.09th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 34.19% for helix (69.31st percentile), 41.45% for sheet (89.65th percentile), and 26.00% for turn (29.07th percentile). The instability index is 35.41 (10.98th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 7.34 (53.26th percentile).
