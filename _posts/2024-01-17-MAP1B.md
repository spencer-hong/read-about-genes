The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [microtubule cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000226), [microtubule bundle formation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001578), [neuron migration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001764), [axonogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007409), and [synapse assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007416). It enables functions such as [actin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003779), [structural molecule activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005198), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [phospholipid binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005543). The gene is located in and active in several cellular components, including the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [microtubule](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005874), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), [postsynaptic density](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0014069), [axon](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030424), [dendrite](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030425), [growth cone](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030426), [somatodendritic compartment](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0036477), [neuronal cell body](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043025), [varicosity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043196), [dendritic spine](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043197), [perikaryon](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043204), [perinuclear region of cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048471), [apical dendrite](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097440), [basal dendrite](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097441), and [hippocampal mossy fiber](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097457). Additionally, it is part of the [microtubule associated complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005875) and is active in the [synapse](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045202). The gene also plays roles in various responses, including those to xenobiotic stimulus, mechanical stimulus, carbohydrate, inorganic substance, estradiol, vitamin A, insecticide, growth factor stimulus, and peptide hormone stimulus. Furthermore, it is involved in the regulation of microtubule depolymerization and polymerization, neuron projection development, peripheral nervous system axon regeneration, dendrite development, induction of synaptic plasticity by chemical substance, establishment of monopolar cell polarity, cellular response to growth factor stimulus, cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus, odontoblast differentiation, and mitochondrion transport along microtubule.


The gene length is 57,529 base pairs (69.97% of all genes), the mature length is 1,982 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 55,044 base pairs.


The gene MAP1B (NCBI ID: 4131) has been mentioned in [121 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MAP1B%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1986, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1996 and 2013.


The top five publications mentioning MAP1B, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Activity-associated miRNA are packaged in Map1b-enriched exosomes released from depolarized neurons.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25053844)" (2014) with a relative citation ratio of 6.34, "[Abnormal expression of two microtubule-associated proteins (MAP2 and MAP5) in specific subfields of the hippocampal formation in schizophrenia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1961755)" (1991) with a relative citation ratio of 5.91, "[The microtubule binding domain of microtubule-associated protein MAP1B contains a repeated sequence motif unrelated to that of MAP2 and tau.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2480963)" (1989) with a relative citation ratio of 5.63, "[Defects in axonal elongation and neuronal migration in mice with disrupted tau and map1b genes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10973990)" (2000) with a relative citation ratio of 5.39, and "[MAP5: a novel brain microtubule-associated protein under strong developmental regulation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3819779)" (1986) with a relative citation ratio of 4.99. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MAP1B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000131711-MAP1B) is a gene involved in deafness and non-syndromic deafness, with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and it is primarily localized in the cytosol and equatorial segment. The gene is expressed in neuronal tissues, with a transcription-related function, and is also found in ciliated cells with ion channel activity. In single-cell expression clusters, it is associated with smooth muscle cells involved in muscle contraction.
