The gene is part of the [voltage-gated sodium channel complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001518) and enables [voltage-gated sodium channel activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005248). It is involved in [sodium ion transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006814) and [sodium ion transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035725), and plays a role in the [behavioral response to pain](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048266) and [cardiac muscle cell action potential involved in contraction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0086002). Additionally, it is located in the [sarcoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016528).


The gene length is 11,402 base pairs (28.51% of all genes), the mature length is 1,393 base pairs (34.78% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 8,241 base pairs (28.58% of all genes).


The gene SCN3A, with NCBI ID 6328, has been mentioned in [54 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SCN3A%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning SCN3A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Nav1.3 sodium channels: rapid repriming and slow closed-state inactivation display quantitative differences after expression in a mammalian cell line and in spinal sensory neurons.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11487618)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 4.95), "[Structural basis for modulation of human Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 by clinical drug and selective antagonist.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35277491)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 4.52), "[Sodium channels SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN3A in familial autism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12610651)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 4.27), "[Mutations in SCN3A cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29466837)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 3.17), and "[Nerve injury induces robust allodynia and ectopic discharges in Nav1.3 null mutant mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17052333)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 3.07). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SCN3A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000153253-SCN3A) is a gene encoding a protein with molecular functions as an ion channel, specifically a voltage-gated sodium channel. It has been implicated in disease variants related to epilepsy and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. The gene's expression is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in the brain, particularly in neuronal signaling clusters. In blood, it is expressed in B-cells with unknown function. At the cellular level, SCN3A is expressed in ciliated cells involved in ion channel activity and in neurons related to neuronal signaling. Evidence supporting these functions is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [MYOD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4654), and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) was found to be regulating in 2 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as breast cancer, thoracic cancer, male reproductive organ cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, intestinal cancer, large intestine cancer, gastrointestinal system cancer, myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, colon cancer, and lung cancer. Additionally, the data highlights associations with infectious diseases like diarrhea, hand, foot and mouth disease, and viral infectious diseases. Neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, and cognitive disorders are also implicated. Furthermore, the data includes associations with musculoskeletal system diseases like arthritis, osteoarthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease.



The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, fetal brain, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, and occipital lobe, as well as in the pituitary gland. Additionally, expression is noted in leukemia lymphoblastic cells (MOLT-4).


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including axon guidance, developmental biology, interaction between L1 and ankyrins, and L1CAM interactions.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.03085 (85.35th percentile), indicating a slightly hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -23.002 (9.23rd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.9946 (19.72nd percentile). The protein has a propensity for secondary structures with 32.35% helix (53.71st percentile), 40.35% sheet (87.27th percentile), and 27.7% turn (44.61st percentile) affinities. The instability index is 39.625 (21.09th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.5996 (20.58th percentile).
