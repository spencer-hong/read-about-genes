The gene length is 386 base pairs (0.24 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 386 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 386 base pairs.


The gene PON1 (NCBI ID: 5444) has been the subject of [1,526 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PON1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1953, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2016.


The top five publications mentioning PON1, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows: "[Paraoxonase prevents accumulation of lipoperoxides in low-density lipoprotein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1650712)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 22.86), "[Purification of human serum paraoxonase/arylesterase. Evidence for one esterase catalyzing both activities.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1673382)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 17.52), "[Human paraoxonases (PON1, PON2, and PON3) are lactonases with overlapping and distinct substrate specificities.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15772423)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 12.51), "[Paraoxonase-1 is a major determinant of clopidogrel efficacy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21170047)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 11.92), and "[Prenatal exposure to organophosphates, paraoxonase 1, and cognitive development in childhood.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21507778)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 10.65). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [None](https://www.proteinatlas.org/None-None) functions as a hydrolase and is implicated in cancer-related processes. Evidence supporting its role is available at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in the liver, where it is associated with plasma proteins. In the brain, it is particularly expressed in the cerebellum, where it is involved in nucleic acid binding. Additionally, the gene is expressed in leukemia cell lines, specifically in T-cell receptor clusters, and in hepatocytes, where it plays a role in metabolism. While the gene is unprognostic for several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, its expression patterns suggest potential functional significance in specific tissue and cell types.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.





The PON1 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [aspartate aminotransferase, cytoplasmic levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36168886), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Aspartic Acid](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001224) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, PON1 is associated with [sulfiredoxin-1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354), closely related to the MeSH term [Thioredoxins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013879), and [testis-expressed sequence 29 protein levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354), which maps to the MeSH term [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506). These associations highlight the diverse roles of PON1 in various biological processes.





The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.091 (78.77th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -16.43 (14.06th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.997 (29.53rd percentile), with a secondary structure composition of 32.68% helix (56.65th percentile), 41.69% sheet (90.18th percentile), and 30.42% turn (66.95th percentile).
