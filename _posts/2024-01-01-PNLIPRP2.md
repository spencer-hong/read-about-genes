The gene length is 482.0 base pairs (0.4% of all genes). The mature length is 482.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 482.0 base pairs.


The gene PNLIPRP2, with NCBI ID 5408, has been the subject of [17 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PNLIPRP2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1969, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2011.


The top five publications mentioning PNLIPRP2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Two novel human pancreatic lipase related proteins, hPLRP1 and hPLRP2. Differences in colipase dependence and in lipase activity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1379598)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 3.69), "[Structure and Function of Pancreatic Lipase-Related Protein 2 and Its Relationship With Pathological States.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34290745)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 2.19), "[Human pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 is a galactolipase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15287741)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 1.99), "[Structure of human pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 with the lid in an open conformation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18702514)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 1.72), and "[BSSL and PLRP2: key enzymes for lipid digestion in the newborn examined using the Caco-2 cell line.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21865348)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 1.51). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1045), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [HNF4A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3172) and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) were found to be regulating in 2 experiments each.





PNLIPRP2 has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [LDL cholesterol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594039), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Cholesterol, LDL](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008078) via a direct synonym match. Additionally, it is associated with [Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32154731), mapped to the MeSH term [Lipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008074) through an embedding match using [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0). Other associations include [Phosphatidylcholine (18:0_18:1) levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35668104), mapped to the MeSH term [Phosphatidylcholines](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D010713) via an embedding match, and [Total cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887591), mapped to the MeSH term [Cholesterol](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D002784) through an embedding match. Furthermore, PNLIPRP2 is linked to [Urine galactosylglycerol levels in chronic kidney disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37277652), which maps to the MeSH term [Kidney](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007668) via an embedding match.
