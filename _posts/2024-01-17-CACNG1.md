The gene enables [voltage-gated calcium channel activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005245) and [calcium channel regulator activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005246), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), [T-tubule](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030315), and [sarcolemma](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042383). The gene plays a role in the [positive regulation of muscle contraction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045933), [establishment of localization in cell](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051649), [sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ion transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070296), [calcium ion transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070588), and [regulation of calcium ion transmembrane transport via high voltage-gated calcium channel](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902514). Additionally, it is part of the [L-type voltage-gated calcium channel complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990454).


The gene length is 23,488 base pairs (46.12% of all genes), the mature length is 1,303 base pairs (32.12% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 22,800 base pairs (55.2% of all genes).


The gene CACNG1 (NCBI ID: 786) has been mentioned in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CACNG1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1993, with the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1993 and 1996.


The top publications mentioning CACNG1 include "[Molecular characterization of the gene encoding the gamma subunit of the human skeletal muscle 1,4-dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel (CACNLG), cDNA sequence, gene structure, and chromosomal location.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8387489)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 1.02), "[Localization of the gamma-subunit of the skeletal muscle L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel gene (CACNLG) to human chromosome band 17q24 by in situ hybridization and identification of a polymorphic repetitive DNA sequence at the gene locus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8404045)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 0.22), and "[Radiation hybrid mapping of skeletal muscle calcium channel genes CACNB1 and CACNG1 to porcine chromosome 12 and CACNA2D1 to porcine chromosome 9.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16026353)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.07). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CACNG1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000108878-CACNG1) is a gene involved in calcium channel, ion channel, and voltage-gated channel functions. It is an FDA-approved drug target with evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in some tissues and is particularly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in striated muscle contraction. In the brain, it is found in neurons with mixed functions. Additionally, CACNG1 is expressed in breast cancer cell lines, although its function in this context is unknown. Single-cell expression data indicate its presence in skeletal myocytes, contributing to muscle contraction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 2 experiments, [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 2 experiments, [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) with 2 experiments, and [OGG1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4968) with 2 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of mental health diseases.


The gene CACNG1 has been associated with [aspartate aminotransferase levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Transaminases](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000637) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, salivary gland, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji and Daudi), heart, liver, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscle, and tongue.
