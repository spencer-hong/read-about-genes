The gene is located in the [Golgi membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000139) and the [endoplasmic reticulum](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005783), and is active in the [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794). It is involved in [peptidyl-tyrosine sulfation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006478) and the [3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050427). The gene enables [protein-tyrosine sulfotransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008476) and [protein homodimerization activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042803).


The gene length is 126,638 base pairs (86.16% of all genes), the mature length is 3,827 base pairs (82.17% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 110,651 base pairs (89.88% of all genes).


The gene TPST2 (NCBI ID: 8459) has been mentioned in [7 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TPST2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2006, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2016.


The top 5 publications mentioning TPST2, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Crystal structure of human tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase-2 reveals the mechanism of protein tyrosine sulfation reaction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23481380)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.48), "[Differential enzymatic characteristics and tissue-specific expression of human TPST-1 and TPST-2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17028309)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 0.87), and "[Catalytic mechanism of Golgi-resident human tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase-2: a mass spectrometry approach.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20462768)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 0.54). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[TPST2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000128294-TPST2) is a transferase with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the pancreas, where it is involved in proteolysis. In the brain, it is associated with astrocyte-neuron interactions, and in cell lines, it is linked to kidney cancer membrane components. Additionally, TPST2 is found in plasma cells, where it plays a role in protein processing. The gene is part of blood expression cluster 42, which is involved in non-specific vesicular transport.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), and [SS18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6760), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including immune system disease, various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and nervous system diseases like Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, the data highlights links to substance-related disorders, including alcohol and nicotine dependence, as well as musculoskeletal system diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and bone inflammation disease.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the pancreas and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the liver, thyroid, CD56+ NK cells, whole blood, lung, pancreas, and pancreatic islet.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.094 (78.57th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 10.26 at pH 7.0 (82nd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.996 (22.84th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 34% helix (67.48th percentile), 35.5% sheet (63.09th percentile), and 27.1% turn (38.5th percentile). The instability index is 34.41 (9.1st percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.22 (85.11th percentile). The protein has a length of 377 amino acids (42.23rd percentile) and a molecular weight of 41911.36 Da (41.92nd percentile).
