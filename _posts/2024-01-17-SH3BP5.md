[SH3BP5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000131370-SH3BP5) is a gene that functions as a guanine-nucleotide releasing factor. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and nuclear bodies. The gene is part of Cluster 24 in blood expression, Cluster 66 in tissue expression, Cluster 34 in brain expression, Cluster 55 in cell line expression, and Cluster 41 in single cell expression, indicating its involvement in transcription and mixed functions. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) and [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942), and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, as well as metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Additionally, the data highlights links to cardiovascular system disease, kidney disease, nervous system disease, and mental health conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Furthermore, associations with musculoskeletal system diseases like osteoarthritis and arthritis, as well as eye diseases including retinal disease, are also noted.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD56+ NK cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), adrenal cortex, adrenal gland, and ovary.
