Additionally, it is located in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062).


The gene length is 166,118.0 base pairs (90.33% of all genes), the mature length is 3,461.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 109,113.5 base pairs.


The gene FCGBP (NCBI ID: 8857) has been mentioned in [16 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FCGBP%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2001 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2009 and 2021. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning FCGBP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Proteomic analyses of the two mucus layers of the colon barrier reveal that their main component, the Muc2 mucin, is strongly bound to the Fcgbp protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19432394)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 3.67), "[NT5E and FcGBP as key regulators of TGF-1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are associated with tumor progression and survival of patients with gallbladder cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24310606)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 3.17), "[Human intestinal TFF3 forms disulfide-linked heteromers with the mucus-associated FCGBP protein and is released by hydrogen sulfide.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20423149)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 2.09), "[A bioinformatic analysis: the overexpression and clinical significance of FCGBP in ovarian cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33686968)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 2.07), and "[IgGFc-binding protein in pregnancies complicated by spontaneous preterm delivery: a retrospective cohort study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33731725)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.94). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[FCGBP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000275395-FCGBP) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and it is primarily expressed in the intestine, where it is involved in digestion. Subcellularly, FCGBP is located in the Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and cytokinetic bridge. In the brain, it is non-specifically expressed in the vasculature. Additionally, FCGBP is expressed in mucus-secreting cells and intestinal goblet cells, where it plays a role in mucin production.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, and [RING1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6015), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), each with 2 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cancer, particularly lung cancer and its subtypes such as non-small cell lung carcinoma. Additionally, the data highlights diseases of cellular proliferation and respiratory system cancers.


The gene FCGBP has been associated with [Hodgkin's lymphoma](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34216518), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Hodgkin Disease](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006689) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the thyroid, colon, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the thyroid, CD8+ T cells, placenta, trachea, colon, small intestine, and fetal thyroid.



The mouse ortholog gene 215384 and its human ortholog gene 8857 are associated with abnormal eye morphology, a phenotype observed in both sexes. Additionally, these orthologs are linked to abnormal seminal vesicle morphology, although this phenotype is not observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.1102 (77.33rd percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The protein exhibits a charge of -175.896 at pH 7.0 (0.18th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.995 (20.07th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 23.24% for helix (2.71st percentile), 30.99% for sheet (33.88th percentile), and 33.89% for turn (85.58th percentile). The instability index is 44.08 (35.95th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 5.14 (10.43rd percentile).
