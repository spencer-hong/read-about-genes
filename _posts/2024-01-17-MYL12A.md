The gene is located in the [stress fiber](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001725), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [Z disc](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030018), and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). It is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and is part of the [myosin II complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016460). The gene enables [calcium ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005509), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [glutamate receptor binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035254). It is involved in the [regulation of cell shape](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008360), [platelet aggregation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070527), and [protein localization to plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0072659).


The gene length is 55,663 base pairs (69.22% of all genes), the mature length is 910 base pairs (18.62% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 53,209.5 base pairs (76.81% of all genes).


The gene MYL12A (NCBI ID: 10627) has been mentioned in [1 publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MYL12A%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 2001, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2001 to 2001.


The top publication mentioning MYL12A is "[Steady-state kinetics of MgATP splitting by native myosin RLC-free subfragment 1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11325532)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 0.0). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MYL12A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000101608-MYL12A) is a motor protein with myosin and muscle protein functions. It is detected in all tissues at the RNA level and is particularly expressed in heart muscle, where it plays a role in cardiac muscle contraction. In the brain, its expression is non-specific and related to metabolism. MYL12A is also found in cardiomyocytes, contributing to muscle contraction. Evidence for this protein is supported at the protein level. Additionally, MYL12A is expressed in basophils, although its function in these cells is unknown.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [IKZF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10320), and [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733), each shown to be regulating in 6 experiments.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) with 3 experiments, [CUX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6830) with 1 experiment, [ZNF143](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861) with 2 experiments, and [ZNF263](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) with 2 experiments. These TFs were found to regulate gene expression in multiple Perturb-seq experiments, highlighting their significant roles in transcriptional regulation.


The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, disease of mental health, substance-related disorder, substance dependence, drug dependence, and cocaine dependence.



The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including heart, muscle, and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in various tissues and cell types such as Heart, CD56+ NK Cells, CD8+ T cells, Whole Blood, Smooth Muscle, Bronchial Epithelial Cells, colon, and Lymph node.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including axon guidance, developmental biology, EPH-Ephrin signaling, and Ephrin signaling.


The mouse ortholog gene 67938 and its human ortholog 10627 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities observed in both sexes, including decreased circulating fructosamine level, decreased circulating serum albumin level, decreased hematocrit, decreased hemoglobin content, decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and decreased mean corpuscular volume.
