The gene enables [molecular function](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003674), specifically [nucleic acid binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003676) and [calmodulin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005516). It is active in the [cellular component](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005575), particularly the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), and is involved in [biological processes](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008150).


The gene length is 58,220 base pairs (70.23rd percentile), the mature length is 3,163 base pairs (74.76th percentile), and the primary transcript length is 43,776 base pairs (72.14th percentile).


ARPP21 has been mentioned in [23 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ARPP21%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1989, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning ARPP21, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Combined transplantation of human mesenchymal stem cells and human retinal progenitor cells into the subretinal space of RCS rats.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28298640)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.96), "[Comparative evaluation of retreatability of bioceramic sealer (BioRoot RCS) and epoxy resin (AH Plus) sealer with two different retreatment files: An *in vitro* study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34475687)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.78), "[Loss of CARM1 results in hypomethylation of thymocyte cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein and deregulated early T cell development.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15096520)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 1.4), "[Layer-specific blood-flow MRI of retinitis pigmentosa in RCS rats.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22721720)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 1.37), and "[Analysis-rcs-data: Open-Source Toolbox for the Ingestion, Time-Alignment, and Visualization of Sense and Stimulation Data From the Medtronic Summit RC+S System.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34322004)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.21). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ARPP21](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000172995-ARPP21) is a gene with a molecular function in calmodulin-binding, supported by evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and the protein is localized to the nucleoli and cytosol. ARPP21 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 44 in plasmacytoid DCs, Cluster 33 in brain tissue related to neuronal signaling, Cluster 33 in brain cells related to mixed function, Cluster 35 in the RS4;11 cell line, and Cluster 34 in single-cell neurons involved in neuronal signaling. The gene's prognostic significance in cancer is unprognostic for Breast Invasive Carcinoma (validation), Glioblastoma Multiforme, and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (validation).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, followed by [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146), [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each with 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including immune system disease, various metabolic disorders such as acquired metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism disease, and glucose metabolism disease. Notably, there are strong links to diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the data highlights associations with mental health conditions, including substance-related disorders and nicotine dependence. Lymphatic system diseases, such as lymph node disease and lymphadenitis, are also implicated, along with specific conditions like Kawasaki disease and gestational diabetes.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, brain, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in multiple brain regions such as the Amygdala, Whole brain, Fetal brain, Caudate nucleus, Medulla Oblongata, Occipital Lobe, and Pons.
