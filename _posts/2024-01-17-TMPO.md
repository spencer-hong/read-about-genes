The gene is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and the [nuclear envelope](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005635). It is part of [chromatin](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000785) and enables [DNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003677), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [lamin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005521), and [cadherin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045296).


The gene length is 6,694 base pairs (18.31% of all genes), the mature length is 694 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 6,423 base pairs.


The gene TMPO (NCBI ID: 7112) has been mentioned in [89 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TMPO%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1975 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1981 and 2000. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning TMPO, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Subpopulations of human T lymphocytes. II. Effect of thymopoietin, corticosteroids, and irradiation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/303151)" (1977) with a relative citation ratio of 4.9, "[MAN1, an inner nuclear membrane protein that shares the LEM domain with lamina-associated polypeptide 2 and emerin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10671519)" (2000) with a relative citation ratio of 4.42, "[A-type lamins bind both hetero- and euchromatin, the latter being regulated by lamina-associated polypeptide 2 alpha.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26798136)" (2016) with a relative citation ratio of 4.27, "[The isolation of thymopoietin (thymin).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/165765)" (1975) with a relative citation ratio of 3.98, and "[Thymic hormone-containing cells VI. Immunohistologic evidence for the simultaneous presence of thymulin, thymopoietin and thymosin alpha 1 in normal and pathological human thymuses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6389155)" (1984) with a relative citation ratio of 3.28. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TMPO](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000120802-TMPO) is a DNA-binding gene implicated in cardiomyopathy, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized to the nuclear membrane. Its expression is associated with various clusters, including Cluster 33 in blood (non-specific - ATP binding), Cluster 67 in tissues (lymphoid tissue & bone marrow - cell proliferation), Cluster 31 in the brain (non-specific - transcription), Cluster 38 in cell lines (non-specific - transcription), and Cluster 52 in single cells (non-specific - cell proliferation).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088), [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), and [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various metabolic disorders, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, and glucose metabolism diseases. Specifically, there are strong links to diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the data highlights associations with kidney diseases, including urinary system diseases, kidney failure, chronic kidney failure, and end-stage renal failure.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, fetal liver, thymus, and leukemia lymphoblastic (MOLT-4) cells.


The input data highlights various pathways involved in the cell cycle, particularly focusing on nuclear envelope dynamics and mitotic phases. These include the clearance of nuclear envelope membranes from chromatin, initiation of nuclear envelope reformation, nuclear envelope reassembly, and depolymerisation of the nuclear lamina. Additionally, the data covers broader cell cycle processes such as mitotic prophase, nuclear envelope breakdown, and specific mitotic phases like anaphase and metaphase.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.656 (20.71 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 6.34 at pH 7.0 (72.23 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.014 (89.74 percentile).
