The gene length is 502.0 base pairs (0.49% of all genes), with a mature length of 502.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 502.0 base pairs.


The gene POLH, with NCBI ID 5429, has been the subject of [162 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLH%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1999, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2014.


The top five publications mentioning POLH, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Interaction of human DNA polymerase eta with monoubiquitinated PCNA: a possible mechanism for the polymerase switch in response to DNA damage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15149598)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 11.59), "[hRAD30 mutations in the variant form of xeroderma pigmentosum](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10398605)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 11.5), "[Mechanisms of accurate translesion synthesis by human DNA polymerase eta](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10856253)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 7.47), "[Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) correcting protein from HeLa cells has a thymine dimer bypass DNA polymerase activity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10369688)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 6.63), and "[Fidelity of human DNA polymerase eta](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10713043)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 5.96). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[Xeroderma pigmentosum](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) is a DNA-binding protein with multiple molecular functions, including DNA-directed DNA polymerase, mutator protein, nucleotidyltransferase, and transferase. It is implicated in xeroderma pigmentosum and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the nucleoplasm. It is associated with various expression clusters, including nuclear processes in blood, transcription in tissues, immune response in the brain, humoral immune response in lymphoma cell lines, and spermatid development in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) and [E2F6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1876) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.4097 (44.97th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 10.65 at pH 7.0 (82.73rd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.009 (78.08th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 32.96% helix (59.01st percentile), 31.28% sheet (35.42nd percentile), and 29.45% turn (59.67th percentile). The instability index is 52.39 (64.82nd percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.74 (72.14th percentile). The protein has a length of 713 amino acids (76.15th percentile) and a molecular weight of 78412.53 Da (75.37th percentile).
