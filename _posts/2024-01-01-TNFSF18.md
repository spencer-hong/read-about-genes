The gene length is 1,435,601.0 base pairs (99.89% of all genes), the mature length is 1,785.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 723,070.0 base pairs (99.69% of all genes).


The gene TNFSF18, with NCBI ID 8995, has been the subject of [53 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TNFSF18%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1982, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning TNFSF18, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The GITR-GITRL interaction: co-stimulation or contrasuppression of regulatory activity?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16868552)" (2006) with a relative citation ratio of 3.6, "[Trimer stabilization, oligomerization, and antibody-mediated cell surface immobilization improve the activity of soluble trimers of CD27L, CD40L, 41BBL, and glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor ligand.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19596991)" (2009) with a relative citation ratio of 2.28, "[Increased GITRL Impairs the Function of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells and Exacerbates Primary Sj√∂gren Syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30760623)" (2019) with a relative citation ratio of 2.12, "[GITR/GITRL: more than an effector T cell co-stimulatory system.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17407102)" (2007) with a relative citation ratio of 2.08, and "[The Role of GITR/GITRL Interaction in Autoimmune Diseases.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33163004)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 1.87. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [Cytokine](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) functions as a cytokine and has evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in endocrine and neural tissues of unknown function (Cluster 32), neurons and synapses related to synaptic function (Cluster 52), adipocytes and endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis (Cluster 48), and macrophages associated with innate immune response (Cluster 58). The gene is unprognostic for Breast Invasive Carcinoma (validation), Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma (validation), Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (validation).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 3 experiments, and [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) with 2 experiments.
