The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [carbohydrate binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030246), as well as [identical protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042802). It is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and is active on the [external side of the plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009897).


The gene length is 15,253 base pairs (35.41% of all genes), the mature length is 2,661 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 15,253 base pairs.


CLEC2B has been mentioned in [5 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CLEC2B%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2013.


The top 5 publications mentioning CLEC2B, ranked by their relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows: [AICL: a new activation-induced antigen encoded by the human NK gene complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9038101) (1997) (relative citation ratio: 0.78), [Genetically coupled receptor-ligand pair NKp80-AICL enables autonomous control of human NK cell responses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23929856) (2013) (relative citation ratio: 0.78), [CLEC2A: a novel, alternatively spliced and skin-associated member of the NKC-encoded AICL-CD69-LLT1 family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18046548) (2007) (relative citation ratio: 0.47), [Tumor cells of non-hematopoietic and hematopoietic origins express activation-induced C-type lectin, the ligand for killer cell lectin-like receptor F1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20663776) (2010) (relative citation ratio: 0.42), and [Cellular Mechanisms Controlling Surfacing of AICL Glycoproteins, Cognate Ligands of the Activating NK Receptor NKp80.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29980609) (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.19).

[CLEC2B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110852-CLEC2B) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in neutrophils (Cluster 35) and bone marrow (Cluster 77), where it is associated with protein binding and cell proliferation, respectively. In the brain, it shows non-specific expression related to vasculature (Cluster 12). Additionally, CLEC2B is expressed in myeloid leukemia cell lines (Cluster 14), involved in the innate immune response, and in NK-cells and T-cells (Cluster 78), where it plays a role in the immune system and transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2353) with 6 experiments, [JUNB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3726) and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) each with 5 experiments, and [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024) and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) each with 4 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various metabolic disorders, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, glucose metabolism diseases, diabetes mellitus, and specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus.



The gene is expressed in various immune cell types, including CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells, as well as in whole blood. Additionally, expression is observed in the appendix and the uterus corpus.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.4483 (40.61 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 6.78 at pH 7.0 (73.61 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.996 (23.65 percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 26.2% helix (8.29 percentile), 36.9% sheet (72.45 percentile), and 25.5% turn (25.18 percentile). The instability index is 41.23 (26.09 percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.02 (79.82 percentile). The protein has a length of 149 amino acids (7.97 percentile) and a molecular weight of 17306.72 Da (8.64 percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, which can be found [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
