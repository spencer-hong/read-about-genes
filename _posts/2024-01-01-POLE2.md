The gene length is 486.0 base pairs (0.41 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 486.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 486.0 base pairs.


The gene POLE2, with NCBI ID 5427, has been featured in [7 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLE2%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2001, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning POLE2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Berberine Inhibits FOXM1 Dependent Transcriptional Regulation of POLE2 and Interferes With the Survival of Lung Adenocarcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35173608)" (2022) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 1.45, "[A novel mutation in the POLE2 gene causing combined immunodeficiency.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26365386)" (2016) with an RCR of 1.2, "[Knockdown of POLE2 expression suppresses lung adenocarcinoma cell malignant phenotypes in vitro.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30132567)" (2018) with an RCR of 0.93, "[POLE2 knockdown reduce tumorigenesis in esophageal squamous cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32831648)" (2020) with an RCR of 0.68, and "[POLE2 Serves as a Prognostic Biomarker and Is Associated with Immune Infiltration in Squamous Cell Lung Cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32304567)" (2020) with an RCR of 0.63. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 5 experiments, [PRPF4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9128) with 4 experiments, [TRIM24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8805) with 4 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 4 experiments, and [RNF2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6045) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 18974, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 5427, is associated with various abnormal phenotypes. These include abnormal embryo turning, abnormal eye, heart, liver, midbrain, neural tube, skin, and spleen morphologies, as well as abnormal neural tube closure. Additionally, the gene is linked to enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged spleen, microphthalmia, small heart, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. Notably, abnormal uterus morphology, embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, and small testis are observed, but not in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.177 (71.56th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -6.57 (29.46th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.998 (34.21st percentile). The protein has a length of 527 amino acids (61.49th percentile) and a molecular weight of 59536.49 Da (62.06th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 29.22% for helix (25.19th percentile), 39.28% for sheet (83.97th percentile), and 28.27% for turn (49.81st percentile). The instability index is 46.92 (46.28th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.95 (29.39th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
