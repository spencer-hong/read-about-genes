The gene length is 608,051 base pairs (98.91% of all genes), the mature length is 1,332 base pairs (32.97% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 434,504 base pairs (99.01% of all genes).


The gene CYP2E1, with NCBI ID 1571, has been the subject of [1,000 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CYP2E1%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1984, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2001 and 2014.


The top five publications mentioning CYP2E1, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[Cytochrome P-4502E1: its physiological and pathological role.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9114822)" (1997) with a relative citation ratio of 19.9. Following this, "[Oxidative and reductive metabolism by cytochrome P450 2E1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1537462)" (1992) has a relative citation ratio of 18.4. Additionally, "[Fructose Promotes Leaky Gut, Endotoxemia, and Liver Fibrosis Through Ethanol-Inducible Cytochrome P450-2E1-Mediated Oxidative and Nitrative Stress.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30959577)" (2021) has a relative citation ratio of 14.96. "[Role of CYP2E1 in the hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8662637)" (1996) follows with a relative citation ratio of 14.73. Lastly, "[CYP2E1 and oxidant stress in alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22940046)" (2013) has a relative citation ratio of 12.16.

[CYP2E1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130600-CYP2E1) is a gene with monooxygenase and oxidoreductase molecular functions, implicated in cancer-related processes. Evidence supports its expression at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the liver, plasma proteins, neurons, leukemia cell lines, hepatocytes, and various cancer types. Subcellularly, it localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Its expression clusters include non-specific DNA binding in blood, liver plasma proteins, mixed function in the brain, leukemia T-cell receptor in cell lines, and metabolism in single-cell hepatocytes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), and [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) was found to be regulating in 3 experiments.











The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.199 (69.23rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 4.06 at pH 7.0 (64.92nd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.994 (17.14th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 31.24% helix (43.42nd percentile), 40.0% sheet (86.08th percentile), and 26.6% turn (34.26th percentile). The instability index is 33.65 (8.05th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.28 (62.4th percentile). The protein has a length of 493 amino acids (57.39th percentile) and a molecular weight of 56848.24 Da (59.37th percentile).
