[SSTR2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180616-SSTR2) is a G-protein coupled receptor involved in transduction, with evidence at the protein level. It is an FDA-approved drug target and is detected in many tissues. The gene is primarily located in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. Its expression is notably high in the brain, specifically in neurons related to synaptic function, and in smooth muscle cells involved in signal transduction. Additionally, SSTR2 is expressed in neuronal cell lines associated with visual perception.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [TFAP2C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7022) and [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) were found in 4 experiments each, while [ME3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10873) was identified in 3 experiments.

Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), subthalamic nucleus, cerebellum peduncles, atrioventricular node, ciliary ganglion, skin, and globus pallidus.


The input data includes various pathways and processes involving proteins, such as class a/1 (rhodopsin-like receptors), defective acth causing obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (pomcd), gpcr ligand binding, metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes, peptide ligand-binding receptors, g alpha (i) signalling events, disease, gpcr downstream signaling, signaling by gpcr, and signal transduction.


The mouse ortholog gene 20606 and its human ortholog 6752 are associated with various morphological abnormalities in both sexes, including abnormal morphologies of the eye, heart, kidney, skin, and spleen. Specifically, these genes are linked to conditions such as enlarged heart, enlarged spleen, small kidney, small spleen, and thick skin.
