The gene length is 897,445 base pairs (99.5% of all genes), the mature length is 9,383 base pairs (98.73% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 441,043 base pairs (99.04% of all genes).


The gene MME (NCBI ID: 4311) has been the subject of [1,027 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MME%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication dating back to 1919. The middle 50% of these publications were published between 1999 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning MME, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition versus enalapril in heart failure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25176015)" (2014) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 155.32, "[Angiotensin-Neprilysin Inhibition in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30415601)" (2019) with an RCR of 42.0, "[The angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a phase 2 double-blind randomised controlled trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22932717)" (2012) with an RCR of 26.82, "[Neutral endopeptidase 24.11: structure, inhibition, and experimental and clinical pharmacology.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8475170)" (1993) with an RCR of 20.25, and "[Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibition compared with enalapril on the risk of clinical progression in surviving patients with heart failure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25403646)" (2015) with an RCR of 19.04. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [MMP2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000087086-MMP2) functions as a hydrolase, metalloprotease, and protease. It is implicated in various diseases, including cancer-related genes, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, neurodegeneration, neuropathy, and spinocerebellar ataxia. Evidence supports its expression at the protein level. The gene is detected in many RNA tissues and is localized in the plasma membrane, centrosome, basal body, and cytosol. It is expressed in neutrophils, kidney, intestine, hindbrain, and connective tissue cells, with roles in protein binding, metabolism, ECM organization, and degranulation.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, followed by [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [CNOT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4849), [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), each with 5 experiments.





Genome-wide association studies have linked the MME gene to several traits and diseases. Notably, it has been associated with [Alzheimer's disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35379992), which was mapped to the MeSH term [Alzheimer Disease](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000544) using a direct synonym match. Additionally, the gene has been linked to [bioavailable testosterone levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32042192) and [total testosterone levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32042192), both of which were mapped to the MeSH term [Testosterone](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013739) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.





The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.447 (40.82 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -11.72 (19.86 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.002 (51.54 percentile). The protein has a predicted secondary structure with 32.7% helix (56.6 percentile), 36.1% sheet (67.24 percentile), and 28.5% turn (52.01 percentile). The instability index is 37.61 (15.63 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.54 (19.3 percentile). The sequence length is 750 amino acids (78.26 percentile), with a molecular weight of 85512.93 Da (78.97 percentile).
