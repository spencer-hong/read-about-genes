The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [embryonic heart tube morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003143), [regulation of gene expression](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010468), and [BMP signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030509). It plays a role in developmental processes such as [embryonic limb morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030326), [limb morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035108), and [embryonic skeletal system morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048704). Additionally, it is involved in [cell migration involved in gastrulation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042074) and [epiboly involved in gastrulation with mouth forming second](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0055113). The gene enables molecular functions like [calcium ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005509) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). Furthermore, it participates in the [negative regulation of smoothened signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045879) and [positive regulation of axon extension involved in axon guidance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048842). The gene also plays a role in the determination of left/right asymmetry in various systems, including the heart, digestive tract, and coronary vasculature development.


The gene length is 136,980 base pairs (87.51% of all genes), the mature length is 3,383 base pairs (77.42% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 86,906 base pairs (86.23% of all genes).


The gene MEGF8 (NCBI ID: 1954) has been mentioned in [6 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MEGF8%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1999, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning MEGF8, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Massively parallel sequencing identifies the gene Megf8 with ENU-induced mutation causing heterotaxy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19218456)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 0.84), "[Skeleton binding protein-1-mediated parasite sequestration inhibits spontaneous resolution of malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34843584)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.59), "[A High-Resolution Map of SBP1 Interactomes in Plasmodium falciparum-infected Erythrocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31476617)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 0.36), "[The Drosophila homologue of MEGF8 is essential for early development.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29884872)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.18), and "[Spatial and temporal deletion reveals a latent effect of Megf8 on the left-right patterning and heart development.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32203821)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.17). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MEGF8](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105429-MEGF8) is a gene implicated in craniosynostosis, with evidence supporting its involvement at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the brain, specifically in astrocytes involved in astrocyte-neuron interactions. Additionally, MEGF8 is expressed in horizontal and bipolar cells, contributing to neuronal signaling. The gene is also part of a non-specific transcription cluster in cell lines.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774), and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.




The MEGF8 gene has been associated with [Glucose levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594039), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Glucose](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005947) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, MEGF8 has been linked to [Pulse pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230300), which directly matches the MeSH term [Blood Pressure](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001794).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the whole brain, colorectal adenocarcinoma, skeletal muscle, atrioventricular node, uterus corpus, and olfactory bulb. Additionally, it is expressed in the brain according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles.
