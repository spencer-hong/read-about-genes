[STK17A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000164543-STK17A) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, functioning as a kinase. Evidence supports its existence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized to nuclear speckles and the plasma membrane. STK17A is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 24 for non-specific transcription in blood, Cluster 70 for immune response in lymphoid tissue, Cluster 2 for neurons in the brain, Cluster 67 for unknown function in cell lines, and Cluster 78 for immune system and transcription in single cells, specifically NK-cells and T-cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341), [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869), [ELF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1997), and [ZEB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6935), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980) was found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cancer, diseases of cellular proliferation, organ system cancer, lung cancer, respiratory system cancer, and general disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including blood, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Lymphoma Burkitt's (Raji), CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), whole blood, and bronchial epithelial cells.
