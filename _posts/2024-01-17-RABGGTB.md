The gene contributes to and enables [Rab geranylgeranyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004663) and enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [zinc ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008270). It is located in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and is part of the [Rab-protein geranylgeranyltransferase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005968). The gene is involved in [visual perception](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007601), [protein geranylgeranylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0018344), and the [protein modification process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0036211). Additionally, it enables [small GTPase binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031267).


The gene length is 493.0 base pairs (0.45 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 493.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 493.0 base pairs.

[RABGGTB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137955-RABGGTB) is a gene encoding a protein with prenyltransferase and transferase molecular functions, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in vesicles. It is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 18 for blood expression related to translation, Cluster 23 for tissue expression related to cellular respiration, Cluster 28 for brain expression in oligodendrocytes with mixed function, Cluster 37 for cell line expression related to mRNA processing, and Cluster 56 for single cell expression in proximal tubular cells involved in amino acid metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 6 experiments, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 5 experiments, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 5 experiments, [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 5 experiments, and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including general diseases, diseases of anatomical entities, kidney diseases, and urinary system diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal gland, lung, and spleen. Additionally, it is expressed in specific cell types and conditions such as Lymphoma (Burkitt's, Raji), CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (negatively selected), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), and promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60).
