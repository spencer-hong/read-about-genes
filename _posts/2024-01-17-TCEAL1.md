The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654). It does not act upstream of or within [negative regulation of gene expression](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010629).


The gene length is 997.0 base pairs (2.23% of all genes). The mature length is 997.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 997.0 base pairs.


The gene TCEAL1 (NCBI ID: 9338) has been mentioned in [12 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TCEAL1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1982 and the middle 50% of publications ranging from 1986 to 2012. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning TCEAL1 include "[Identification of a precursor in the biosynthesis of the p21 transforming protein of harvey murine sarcoma virus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6283143)" (1982) (relative citation ratio: 2.78), "[Autophosphorylation of v-Ha-ras p21 is modulated by amino acid residue 12.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6609366)" (1984) (relative citation ratio: 1.04), "[Phosphorylation of multiple CD3 zeta tyrosine residues leads to formation of pp21 in vitro and in vivo. Structural changes upon T cell receptor stimulation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1531339)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 0.92), "[In vivo CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen: TCEAL1 silencing enhances docetaxel efficacy in prostate cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33033111)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.73), and "[The immunocytochemical localization of new soluble placental tissue proteins (PP14, 16, 17, 19, 20 and PP21) in human and cynomolgus monkey placentae.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3548605)" (1987) (relative citation ratio: 0.65). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TCEAL1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000172465-TCEAL1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, implicated in intellectual disability. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including non-specific transcription in blood, connective tissue ECM organization, hypothalamus neuropeptide signaling, non-specific mRNA processing in cell lines, and transcription in ovarian stromal cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 5 experiments, [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) with 4 experiments, and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) each with 3 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the amygdala, whole brain, cerebellum peduncles, uterus corpus, ovary, and uterus.



The mouse ortholog gene 237052, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 9338, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal eye morphology, decreased lean body mass, increased total body fat amount, and small kidney size. Notably, these phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -1.395 (0.89 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -11.08 (20.84 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.027 (98.93 percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (43.40%, 97.33 percentile) and turns (30.19%, 65.18 percentile), with a lower affinity for sheet structures (17.61%, 1.13 percentile). The instability index is 106.58 (99.72 percentile), suggesting high instability. The isoelectric point is 5.01 (8.02 percentile), with a molecular weight of 18640.65 Da (10.11 percentile). The sequence length is 159 amino acids (9.15 percentile).
