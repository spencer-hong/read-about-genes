The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and signaling receptor activity, and is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and the [external side of plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009897). It is involved in various processes including [cell recognition](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008037), [T cell costimulation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031295), and the [apoptotic signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097190).


The gene length is 56,588 base pairs (69.61% of all genes), the mature length is 1,584 base pairs (40.68% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 22,895 base pairs (55.31% of all genes).


The gene CD5 (NCBI ID: 921) has been mentioned in [948 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CD5%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning CD5 is 1975, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1993 and 2014.


The top five publications mentioning CD5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human lymphocytes making rheumatoid factor and antibody to ssDNA belong to Leu-1+ B-cell subset.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3105056)" (1987) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 12.04, "[CD5+ B lymphocytes, polyreactive antibodies and the human B-cell repertoire.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2482031)" (1989) with an RCR of 11.5, "[Origins and functions of B-1 cells with notes on the role of CD5.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11861604)" (2002) with an RCR of 9.47, "[Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL): a clinicopathologic study of 96 cases with special reference to the immunophenotypic heterogeneity of CD5.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16985183)" (2007) with an RCR of 9.17, and "[CD5 expression is developmentally regulated by T cell receptor (TCR) signals and TCR avidity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9858516)" (1998) with an RCR of 7.44. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CD5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110448-CD5) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and it is notably expressed in T-cells, particularly within the T-cell receptor cluster. In lymphoid tissue, CD5 is involved in cytokine signaling, and in the brain, it is expressed in the cerebral cortex with mixed functions. Additionally, CD5 is expressed in leukemia cell lines, specifically within the T-cell receptor cluster. Single-cell expression data also places CD5 in T-cells, specifically within the T-cell receptor cluster.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 5 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) each with 4 experiments, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 3 experiments, and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 2 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various metabolic disorders, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, glucose metabolism diseases, diabetes mellitus, and specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Whole Blood, Lymphoma (Burkitt's, Daudi), Kidney, Appendix, Tonsil, Thymus, and Leukemia (lymphoblastic, MOLT-4).



The mouse ortholog gene 12507 and its human ortholog gene 921 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal skin morphology, abnormal spleen morphology, and an enlarged spleen. Additionally, abnormal uterus morphology is observed, although this phenotype is not present in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.441 (41.58th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 9.704 at pH 7.0 (80.79th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.001 (47.72nd percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 26.87% for helix (11.14th percentile), 30.30% for sheet (29.94th percentile), and 32.32% for turn (78.36th percentile). The instability index is 47.07 (46.88th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.594 (68.63rd percentile). The protein has a length of 495 amino acids (57.66th percentile) and a molecular weight of 54577.36 Da (56.8th percentile).
