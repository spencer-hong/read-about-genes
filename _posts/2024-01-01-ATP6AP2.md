The gene length is 91,425 base pairs (80.22% of all genes), the mature length is 1,131 base pairs (26.85% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 59,470 base pairs (79.17% of all genes).


The gene ATP6AP2, with NCBI ID 10159, has been featured in [258 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ATP6AP2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2019.


The top five publications mentioning ATP6AP2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Pivotal role of the renin/prorenin receptor in angiotensin II production and cellular responses to renin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12045255)" (2002) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 23.4, "[Effects of aliskiren on blood pressure, albuminuria, and (pro)renin receptor expression in diabetic TG(mRen-2)27 rats.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18490518)" (2008) with an RCR of 6.62, "[A novel signal transduction cascade involving direct physical interaction of the renin/prorenin receptor with the transcription factor promyelocytic zinc finger protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17082479)" (2006) with an RCR of 5.67, "[Slowly progressive, angiotensin II-independent glomerulosclerosis in human (pro)renin receptor-transgenic rats.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17494887)" (2007) with an RCR of 5.3, and "[Prorenin is the endogenous agonist of the (pro)renin receptor. Binding kinetics of renin and prorenin in rat vascular smooth muscle cells overexpressing the human (pro)renin receptor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17984666)" (2007) with an RCR of 4.56. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.


Based on the data from GTRD's database of transcription factor (TF) binding sites and filtered for Perturb-seq data, several transcription factors were identified as significant regulators in multiple experiments. Notably, [TFAP2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) was found to regulate gene expression in three experiments. Additionally, [NFE2L2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829), [GATA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623), and [HIF1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) each showed regulatory activity in two experiments. These findings highlight the critical roles of these transcription factors in gene regulation.








The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.104 (88.09th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -4.93 (33.96th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.997 (28.07th percentile). The protein has a predicted secondary structure with 33.43% helix (63.12th percentile), 40.00% sheet (86.16th percentile), and 31.14% turn (71.49th percentile) affinities. The instability index is 37.08 (14.4th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.76 (24.32nd percentile). The protein is 350 amino acids long (38.03rd percentile) with a molecular weight of 39007.53 Da (38.0th percentile).
