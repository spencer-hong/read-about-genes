[KCNA5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130037-KCNA5) is a gene encoding a protein with molecular functions as an ion channel, specifically a voltage-gated potassium channel. It has been implicated in atrial fibrillation and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence supporting its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is notably expressed in the plasma membrane of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), choroid plexus for transmembrane transport, and in the choroid plexus of the brain with mixed functions. Additionally, it is expressed in leukemia cell lines involved in signal transduction and in bipolar cells related to visual perception.
