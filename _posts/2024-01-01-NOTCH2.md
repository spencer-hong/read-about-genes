The gene length is 607 base pairs (0.71 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 407 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 607 base pairs.


The gene NOTCH2, with NCBI ID 4853, has been featured in [348 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NOTCH2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1992, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2020.


The top five publications mentioning NOTCH2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Long-read sequencing identifies GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC associated with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31332381)" (2019) with a relative citation ratio of 14.46, "[Expansion of GGC repeat in the human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with essential tremor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31819945)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 10.2, "[Human-Specific NOTCH2NL Genes Expand Cortical Neurogenesis through Delta/Notch Regulation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29856955)" (2018) with a relative citation ratio of 8.36, "[miR-195-5p/NOTCH2-mediated EMT modulates IL-4 secretion in colorectal cancer to affect M2-like TAM polarization.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30808369)" (2019) with a relative citation ratio of 8.29, and "[Notch2 receptor signaling controls functional differentiation of dendritic cells in the spleen and intestine.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22018469)" (2011) with a relative citation ratio of 6.79. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [DPF2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5977), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [INTS13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55726), [ZBTB17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7709), and [SMAD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4087), each shown to be regulating in 2 experiments.





The gene NOTCH2 has been associated with [urate levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34226706) through genome-wide association studies. This trait was mapped to the closest existing MeSH term, [Uric Acid](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D014527), using the method called [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.355 (51.58th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -112.89 (0.42nd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.9995 (39.15th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 23.88% (3.36th percentile), 26.18% (11.73rd percentile), and 35.45% (90.46th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 45.58 (41.33rd percentile), with an isoelectric point of 4.95 (7.0th percentile). The protein is 2471 amino acids long (98.57th percentile) and has a molecular weight of 265402.85 Da (98.47th percentile).
