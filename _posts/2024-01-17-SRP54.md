The gene length is 6,455 base pairs (17.75th percentile), the mature length is 1,408 base pairs (35.27th percentile), and the primary transcript length is 6,287 base pairs (22.94th percentile).


The gene SRP54, with NCBI ID 6729, has been mentioned in [39 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SRP54%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1992, and the middle 50% of publications range from 1997 to 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning SRP54, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include studies that highlight the gene's role in various biological processes. The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[Mutations in signal recognition particle SRP54 cause syndromic neutropenia with Shwachman-Diamond-like features.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28972538)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 3.6). Another significant study is "[A chloroplast homologue of the signal recognition particle subunit SRP54 is involved in the posttranslational integration of a protein into thylakoid membranes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7731984)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 3.18). Additionally, "[Mutations in the <i>SRP54</i> gene cause severe congenital neutropenia as well as Shwachman-Diamond-like syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29914977)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 2.97) and "[Empty site forms of the SRP54 and SR alpha GTPases mediate targeting of ribosome-nascent chain complexes to the endoplasmic reticulum.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9182758)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 1.91) are notable. Lastly, "[SRP54 mutations induce congenital neutropenia via dominant-negative effects on XBP1 splicing.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33227812)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.41) is also a key study.

[SRP54](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100883-SRP54) is a gene with molecular functions including hydrolase, ribonucleoprotein, and RNA-binding. It is involved in disease variants and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues and is primarily located in the cytosol. SRP54 is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood (non-specific - cell proliferation), Cluster 68 for tissue (non-specific - protein processing), Cluster 21 for brain (non-specific - metabolism), Cluster 30 for cell line (non-specific - gene expression regulation), and Cluster 36 for single cell (late spermatids - unknown function).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869), [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772), [TCF12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6938), and [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667), each shown to be regulating in 6 experiments.





The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the liver, pituitary, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), B lymphoblasts, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD105+ endothelial cells, pancreatic islets, and testis interstitial cells.


The input data highlights several key biological processes, including the metabolism of proteins, gene expression, SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to the membrane, and translation. These processes are integral to cellular function and protein synthesis.
