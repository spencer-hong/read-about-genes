The gene is located in the [stress fiber](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001725), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005856), [actin cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015629), and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). It is part of the [muscle thin filament tropomyosin](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005862) and is active in the [actin filament](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005884). The gene enables [molecular function](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003674), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [actin filament binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051015). Additionally, it is involved in [muscle contraction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006936) and [actin filament organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007015).


The gene length is 216,371 base pairs (93.28% of all genes), the mature length is 1,990 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 136,360 base pairs (92.59% of all genes).


The gene TPM3 (NCBI ID: 7170) has been mentioned in [203 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TPM3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1977, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning TPM3, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Synthesis of colloidal upconverting NaYF4 nanocrystals doped with Er3+, Yb3+ and Tm3+, Yb3+ via thermal decomposition of lanthanide trifluoroacetate precursors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16756290)" (2006) (RCR: 10.18), "[TPM3-ALK and TPM4-ALK oncogenes in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10934142)" (2000) (RCR: 10.02), "[GPCRs steer G<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> selectivity via TM5-TM6 switches as revealed by structures of serotonin receptors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35714614)" (2022) (RCR: 7.05), "[High-power continuous-wave Tm<sup>3+</sup>:Ho<sup>3+</sup>-codoped fiber laser operation from 2.1 µm to 2.2 µm.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35561396)" (2022) (RCR: 6.7), and "[A mutation in the alpha tropomyosin gene TPM3 associated with autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7704029)" (1995) (RCR: 6.36). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TPM3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000143549-TPM3) is a gene with actin-binding and muscle protein molecular functions. It is involved in various diseases, including cancer-related genes, disease variants, nemaline myopathy, and is considered a proto-oncogene. Evidence for TPM3 is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in actin filaments and the cytosol. TPM3 is part of Cluster 29 for blood expression, Cluster 14 for tissue expression related to skeletal muscle and muscle contraction, Cluster 14 for brain expression related to neurons and synaptic function, Cluster 45 for cell line expression related to nuclear processes, and Cluster 45 for single cell expression with mixed function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066) with 6 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [PHF8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23133) each with 5 experiments, and [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908) and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) each with 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of mental health diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, blood, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the thyroid, subthalamic nucleus, temporal lobe, cerebellum, fetal thyroid, skeletal muscle, and tongue.


The input data highlights three key pathways involved in muscle contraction: muscle contraction, striated muscle contraction, and smooth muscle contraction.
