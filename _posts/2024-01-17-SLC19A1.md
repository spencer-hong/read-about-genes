[SLC19A1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000173638-SLC19A1) is a gene involved in cancer-related processes and hereditary hemolytic anemia, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized to the plasma membrane. It is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, playing a role in degranulation, and is particularly active in the choroid plexus, where it is involved in transmembrane transport and mitochondrial functions. Additionally, SLC19A1 is expressed in leukemia cell lines and cytotrophoblasts, further highlighting its diverse roles in various cellular contexts.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 5 experiments, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments, [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341) with 4 experiments, and [PHF8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23133) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including immune system disease, cardiovascular system disease, general disease, disease of anatomical entity, and hypersensitivity reaction disease.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung, blood, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Lymphoma (Burkitt's), Liver, CD34+ cells, CD33+ Myeloid cells, CD14+ Monocytes, Whole Blood, and Lung.


The input data highlights various pathways and defects related to metabolism, particularly focusing on vitamins and cofactors. Key pathways include the metabolism of water-soluble vitamins and cofactors, as well as defects in biotin and cobalamin metabolism. Notably, defective genes such as AMN, BTD, CD320, CUBN, GIF, HLCS, LMBRD1, MMAA, MMAB, MMACHC, MMADHC, MTR, MTRR, MUT, and TCN2 are implicated in conditions like hereditary megaloblastic anemia, methylmalonic aciduria, and intrinsic factor deficiency. These defects underscore the critical roles of these genes in maintaining proper metabolic functions and preventing associated diseases.
