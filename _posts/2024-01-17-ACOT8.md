[ACOT8](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000101473-ACOT8) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase and serine esterase molecular functions. Evidence for this gene is established at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in vesicles and mitochondria. The gene is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 7 in blood, which is involved in the innate immune response, and Cluster 54 in tissues, which is related to basic cellular processes. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 14, linked to neurons and synaptic function. Additionally, it is found in Cluster 62 in cell lines, associated with plasma proteins, and Cluster 5 in single cells, related to enterocytes and absorption.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829), [GATA3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2625), and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.




The genome-wide association study has identified a link between ACOT8 and [Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 8 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354), with the closest MeSH match being [Acyltransferases](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000217). This association was determined using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in the adrenal gland and colon according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in the heart, liver, CD14+ monocytes, CD71+ early erythroid cells, whole brain, cerebellum peduncles, and colorectal adenocarcinoma.


The proteins are involved in various metabolic pathways, including beta-oxidation of pristanoyl-CoA, peroxisomal lipid metabolism, and beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids. Additionally, they participate in the metabolism of alpha-linolenic (omega3) and linoleic (omega6) acids, as well as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) metabolism. These proteins also play roles in general metabolism, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, and bile acid and bile salt metabolism, including the synthesis of bile acids and bile salts, specifically via 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol.


The mouse ortholog gene 170789 and its human ortholog gene 10005 are associated with the phenotype of increased body length, observed in both sexes.
