GRK5 (Gene NCBI ID: 2869) has been mentioned in [84 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GRK5%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1993 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2009 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning GRK5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A GRK5 polymorphism that inhibits beta-adrenergic receptor signaling is protective in heart failure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18425130)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 5.87), "[A genome-wide association study identifies GRK5 and RASGRP1 as type 2 diabetes loci in Chinese Hans.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22961080)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 3.94), "[Cloning and expression of GRK5: a member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7685906)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 3.21), "[GRK5 is a regulator of fibroblast activation and cardiac fibrosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33500351)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 3.03), and "[L41Q polymorphism of the G protein coupled receptor kinase 5 is associated with left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20023040)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 2.61). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[GRK5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198873-GRK5) is a kinase with serine/threonine-protein kinase and transferase molecular functions. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized to the nuclear membrane, nuclear speckles, and plasma membrane. GRK5 is part of Cluster 3 in blood expression, indicating involvement in nuclear processes, and Cluster 7 in tissue expression, suggesting a mixed function in adipose tissue. In the brain, it is associated with Cluster 40, which relates to astrocyte-neuron interactions. Additionally, GRK5 is found in Cluster 64 of cell line expression, indicating a role in the organization of the extracellular matrix in connective tissue cells, and in Cluster 48 of single-cell expression, suggesting involvement in signal transduction in smooth muscle cells.

Additionally, [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), and [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, as well as leukocyte diseases like leukopenia. Additionally, respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, and lower respiratory tract disease are highlighted. Metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, along with obesity and cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and hypertension, are also noted. The data further includes associations with kidney disease, nervous system diseases, mental health disorders, substance dependence, and various musculoskeletal and sensory system diseases. Specific conditions like osteoarthritis, retinal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and dyslexia are also mentioned.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood vessel and lung, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD56+ NK cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), lung, placenta, small intestine, ovary, and fetal lung.


The proteins are involved in various signaling pathways, including G alpha (q) signaling events, the gastrin-CREB signaling pathway via PKC and MAPK, GPCR downstream signaling, signaling by GPCR, and general signal transduction.


The mouse ortholog gene 14773 and its human ortholog gene 2869 are associated with abnormal kidney morphology, a phenotype observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.607 (24.72 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 6.66 at pH 7.0 (73.22 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.006 (68.4 percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 33.9% helix (67.05 percentile), 32.9% sheet (44.69 percentile), and 27.3% turn (40.67 percentile). The instability index is 50.85 (59.99 percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.39 (64.51 percentile). The protein has a length of 590 amino acids (67.71 percentile) and a molecular weight of 67785.82 Da (69.07 percentile).
