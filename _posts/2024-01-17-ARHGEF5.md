The gene is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), [cell projection](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042995), [anchoring junction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070161), [cell periphery](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071944), and [podosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002102). It is involved in various processes such as [myeloid dendritic cell chemotaxis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002408), [actin cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030036), [regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032956), [intracellular signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035556), [positive regulation of JUN kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043507), [regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051056), [positive regulation of DNA-binding transcription factor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051091), [regulation of cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051493), [positive regulation of stress fiber assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051496), [hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0061484), [positive regulation of podosome assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071803), [activation of GTPase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0090630), and [positive regulation of protein import](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1904591). The gene enables [guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005085), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [GTP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005525), and [lipid binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008289). It acts upstream of or within [regulation of GTPase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043087) and is not involved in [regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070372).


The gene length is 90,841.0 base pairs (80.08% of all genes), the mature length is 3,408.5 base pairs (77.69% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 50,343.0 base pairs (75.43% of all genes).

[ARHGEF5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000050327-ARHGEF5) is a guanine-nucleotide releasing factor that functions as a proto-oncogene. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized to the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, and cytosol. ARHGEF5 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 43 for non-specific transcription and translation in blood, Cluster 27 for squamous epithelium keratinization in tissues, Cluster 42 for choroid plexus mitochondria in the brain, Cluster 15 for kidney cancer membrane components in cell lines, and Cluster 5 for enterocytes absorption in single cells.
