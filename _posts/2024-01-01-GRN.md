The gene has a length of 8,760 base pairs (23.01% of all genes), a mature length of 1,971 base pairs, and a primary transcript length of 8,242 base pairs.


The gene GRN (NCBI ID: 2896) has been featured in [872 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GRN%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1973, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2019.


The top five publications mentioning the GRN gene, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Null mutations in progranulin cause ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 17q21.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16862115)" (2006) with a relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) of 24.06, "[Progranulin as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35039149)" (2022) with an RCR of 12.01, "[Neuroimaging signatures of frontotemporal dementia genetics: C9ORF72, tau, progranulin and sporadics.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22366795)" (2012) with an RCR of 10.57, "[Mutations in progranulin are a major cause of ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal lobar degeneration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16950801)" (2006) with an RCR of 9.55, and "[Macrophage-secreted granulin supports pancreatic cancer metastasis by inducing liver fibrosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27088855)" (2016) with an RCR of 9.47. The relative citation ratio measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [ZNF143](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7702), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088) and [BCL3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/602) were found to be regulating in 3 experiments each.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [8243](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8243) with 3 experiments, [6829](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) and [9968](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) each with 2 experiments, and [2623](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623) and [9126](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) each with 1 experiment. These TFs were found to regulate gene expression in multiple Perturb-seq experiments, highlighting their significant roles in transcriptional regulation.
