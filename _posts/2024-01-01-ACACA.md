The gene length is 1,161,878.0 base pairs (99.74% of all genes), the mature length is 3,464.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 712,208.5 base pairs.


The gene ACACA, with NCBI ID 31, has been the subject of [292 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ACACA%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1987, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning ACACA, ranked by their scientific influence, include: "[2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35363499) (2022) (relative citation ratio: 334.52)," "[2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35379503) (2022) (relative citation ratio: 139.72)," "[2018 AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APhA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30586774) (2019) (relative citation ratio: 131.97)," "[2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: Executive Summary: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35363500) (2022) (relative citation ratio: 55.1)," and "[ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Update the 2001 Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Heart Failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16160202) (2005) (relative citation ratio: 54.55)." The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CREB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1385) and [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [POU5F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5460), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), and [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.246 (64.33rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -33.89 (5.08th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.998 (30.28th percentile). The protein has a length of 2346 amino acids (98.38th percentile) and a molecular weight of 265550.74 Da (98.47th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 30.31% for helix (34.74th percentile), 36.79% for sheet (71.65th percentile), and 27.66% for turn (44.26th percentile). The instability index is 41.32 (26.46th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.95 (29.32nd percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
