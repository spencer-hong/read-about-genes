The gene enables [tRNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000049) and [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723), and is involved in [wobble position ribose methylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002130) and [tRNA methylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030488). It is active in and located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), and is also located in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). Additionally, it is part of the [COP9 signalosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008180) and plays a role in the [negative regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008285) and [negative regulation of autophagy](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010507). The gene also acts upstream of the negative effect on the [G1 to G0 transition](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070314) and enables [enzyme regulator activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030234) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515).


The gene length is 84,508 base pairs (78.49% of all genes), the mature length is 2,942 base pairs (71.66% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 20,619 base pairs (52.4% of all genes).


The gene WDR6 (NCBI ID: 11180) has been mentioned in [5 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22WDR6%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2000, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning WDR6, ranked by their relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows. The most influential publication is "[Identification of Restriction Factors by Human Genome-Wide RNA Interference Screening of Viral Host Range Mutants Exemplified by Discovery of SAMD9 and WDR6 as Inhibitors of the Vaccinia Virus K1L-C7L- Mutant.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26242627)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.47). Other notable publications include "[The Cul4-DDB1-WDR3/WDR6 Complex Binds SPAK and OSR1 Kinases in a Phosphorylation-Dependent Manner.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31614064)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.65), "[Association of LKB1 with a WD-repeat protein WDR6 is implicated in cell growth arrest and p27(Kip1) induction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17216128)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 0.58), and "[Molecular cloning, expression analysis, and chromosome mapping of WDR6, a novel human WD-repeat gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10903905)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 0.2).

[WDR6](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000178252-WDR6) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized in the plasma membrane and cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 18 for blood, Cluster 16 for tissues, Cluster 46 for the brain, and Cluster 8 for cell lines, all indicating non-specific functions related to basic cellular processes and mixed functions. Single-cell expression analysis places it in Cluster 39, also associated with non-specific basic cellular processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), and [GATA3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2625), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [BCL3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/602) and [TAF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, thyroid, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the fetal brain, pituitary, fetal thyroid, adrenal cortex, and testis seminiferous tubule.



The mouse ortholog gene 83669 and its human ortholog 11180 are associated with several phenotypes, including abnormal coat/hair pigmentation, increased fasting circulating glucose level, and limb grasping. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.0223 (84.98th percentile), indicating a slightly hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -9.66 (23.02nd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.991 (13.42nd percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 28.81% (22.21st percentile), 36.66% (70.85th percentile), and 30.24% (65.49th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 41.85 (28.22nd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.41 (40.57th percentile). The sequence length is 1121 amino acids (90.25th percentile), with a molecular weight of 121723.22 Da (89.68th percentile).
