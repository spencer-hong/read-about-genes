The gene is part of the [ubiquitin ligase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000151) and the [microtubule associated complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005875). It is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [nuclear body](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016604), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [enzyme binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019899), and [small GTPase binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031267). It is involved in [cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007010), [microtubule nucleation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007020), [protein-containing complex assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0065003), and [negative regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070373). Additionally, it acts upstream of [positive regulation of amyloid precursor protein catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902993).


The gene length is 34,533 base pairs (56.56% of all genes), the mature length is 1,306.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 25,533.5 base pairs.


RANBP9 has been mentioned in [86 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RANBP9%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2006 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning RANBP9, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[When overexpressed, a novel centrosomal protein, RanBPM, causes ectopic microtubule nucleation similar to gamma-tubulin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9817760)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 2.73), "[An AXL/LRP-1/RANBP9 complex mediates DC efferocytosis and antigen cross-presentation in vivo.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24509082)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 2.21), "[Activation of Ras/Erk pathway by a novel MET-interacting protein RanBPM.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12147692)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 2.02), "[Pivotal role of the RanBP9-cofilin pathway in AÎ²-induced apoptosis and neurodegeneration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22361682)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 1.86), and "[Full-sized RanBPM cDNA encodes a protein possessing a long stretch of proline and glutamine within the N-terminal region, comprising a large protein complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11470507)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 1.69). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RANBP9](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000010017-RANBP9) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, nuclear bodies, and cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 12 for non-specific mitochondrial translation in blood, Cluster 4 for basic cellular processes in testis, Cluster 14 for synaptic function in the brain, Cluster 28 for nuclear processes in cell lines, and Cluster 34 for neuronal signaling in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 6 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 5 experiments, [E2F6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1876) with 5 experiments, and [SMAD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4087) with 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including nervous system diseases, eye and adnexa diseases, eye diseases, sensory system diseases, and corneal diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, esophagus, and vagina, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the amygdala, leukemia lymphoblastic (MOLT-4), and multiple regions of the testis, including the interstitial tissue, Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and germ cells.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including axon guidance, developmental biology, and L1CAM interactions.
