The gene is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), and [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739). It is involved in the [negative regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008285) and [negative regulation of cell cycle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045786). Additionally, the gene enables [NADH pyrophosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035529), [ADP-ribose diphosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0047631), and [NAD binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051287).


The gene length is 56,030 base pairs (69.39% of all genes), the mature length is 1,223.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 31,064 base pairs (63.52% of all genes).


NUDT6 has been mentioned in [2 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NUDT6%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2001, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2007.


The top publications mentioning NUDT6 include "[A potential proliferative gene, NUDT6, is down-regulated by green tea catechins at the posttranscriptional level.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19157820)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 0.32) and "[Antisense basic fibroblast growth factor oligonucleotide reduced adhesion of retinal pigment epithelial cells to extracellular matrix molecules and their proliferation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11114601)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 0.09). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[NUDT6](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000170917-NUDT6) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the liver and kidney, suggesting a role in metabolism. In the brain, it is particularly expressed in the cerebral cortex, indicating mixed functional involvement. The gene is also expressed in various cell lines associated with mRNA splicing and the cell cycle. At the single-cell level, NUDT6 is enriched in proximal tubular cells, implying a role in amino acid metabolism. Additionally, its expression in blood is non-specific but related to mitochondrial function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [BCL6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/604), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), and [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cardiovascular system disease, general disease, and diseases of anatomical entities.


The genome-wide association study has identified a link between the NUDT6 gene and [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36224396).


The gene is expressed in the adrenal gland and kidney according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, heart, liver, thyroid, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and leukemia lymphoblastic (MOLT-4) cells.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.353 (51.89th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of 2.018 (57.63rd percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.999 (39.17th percentile), with a secondary structure composition of 31.33% helix (44.18th percentile), 35.44% sheet (62.34th percentile), and 27.53% turn (43.04th percentile). The instability index is 47.36 (47.81st percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.15 (60.51st percentile). The protein has a length of 316 amino acids (32.1st percentile) and a molecular weight of 35678.23 Da (32.92nd percentile).
