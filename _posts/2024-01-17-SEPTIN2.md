[SEPTIN2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000168385-SEPTIN2) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized to various subcellular structures including the plasma membrane, actin filaments, microtubules, cytokinetic bridge, primary cilium, principal piece, and annulus. SEPTIN2 is part of Cluster 10 for blood expression, which is associated with non-specific membrane trafficking, and Cluster 73 for tissue expression, which is linked to breast lactation. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 28, associated with oligodendrocytes and mixed functions. Additionally, SEPTIN2 is found in Cluster 26 for cell line expression, related to non-specific mitochondria and RNA binding, and Cluster 39 for single cell expression, involved in basic cellular processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149) with 7 experiments, [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886) and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) each with 6 experiments, and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) each with 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, cognitive disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorder, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.



The gene is expressed in adipose tissue and thyroid according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, spinal cord, smooth muscle, and testis Leydig cells.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including anchoring of the basal body to the plasma membrane, assembly of the primary cilium, and organelle biogenesis and maintenance.
