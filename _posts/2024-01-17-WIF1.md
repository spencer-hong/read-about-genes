The top 5 publications mentioning WIF1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[HOTAIR, a prognostic factor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, inhibits WIF-1 expression and activates Wnt pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24118380)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 6.48), "[Exosomal circ_0030167 derived from BM-MSCs inhibits the invasion, migration, proliferation and stemness of pancreatic cancer cells by sponging miR-338-5p and targeting the Wif1/Wnt8/β-catenin axis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33971282)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 5.52), "[HMGA2-WIF1 Rearrangements Characterize a Distinctive Subset of Salivary Pleomorphic Adenomas With Prominent Trabecular (Canalicular Adenoma-like) Morphology.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34324456)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 5.17), "[WIF1, a component of the Wnt pathway, is down-regulated in prostate, breast, lung, and bladder cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14517837)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 4.92), and "[Wnt inhibitory factor 1 is epigenetically silenced in human osteosarcoma, and targeted disruption accelerates osteosarcomagenesis in mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19307728)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 4.81). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[WIF1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000156076-WIF1) is a developmental protein with evidence at the protein level, implicated in cancer-related genes. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the retina, involved in visual perception (Cluster 76). In the brain, it is expressed in astrocytes, contributing to astrocyte-neuron interactions (Cluster 40). Additionally, WIF1 is found in Müller glia cells, playing a role in visual perception (Cluster 10). The gene is also expressed in various cell lines associated with cell proliferation (Cluster 32).
