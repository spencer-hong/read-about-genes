The gene is involved in the [long-chain fatty acid metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001676) and [fatty acid transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015908), specifically [long-chain fatty acid transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015909). It enables [long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004467), [very long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031957), and [arachidonate-CoA ligase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0047676), as well as [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524). The gene is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739), [endoplasmic reticulum](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005783), and [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and is active in the [mitochondrial membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031966), [endoplasmic reticulum membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005789), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886).


The gene length is 171,161 base pairs (90.66% of all genes), the mature length is 4,007 base pairs (83.86% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 86,888.5 base pairs (86.22% of all genes).


The gene SLC27A3 (NCBI ID: 11000) has been mentioned in [5 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLC27A3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2006, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2014 and 2016.


The top 5 publications mentioning SLC27A3, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Lipid metabolism enzyme ACSVL3 supports glioblastoma stem cell maintenance and tumorigenicity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24893952)" (2014) (RCR: 1.02), "[Investigation of the fatty acid transporter-encoding genes SLC27A3 and SLC27A4 in autism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26548558)" (2015) (RCR: 0.37), "[Cafeteria diet induces global and <i>Slc27a3</i>-specific hypomethylation in male Wistar rats.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33570456)" (2021) (RCR: 0.27), and "[Isolation, mapping and identification of SNPs for four genes (ACP6, CGN, ANXA9, SLC27A3) from a bovine QTL region on BTA3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16717448)" (2006) (RCR: 0.14). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[SLC27A3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000143554-SLC27A3) is a gene encoding a protein with ligase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. It is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 25 for blood, Cluster 53 for tissue, Cluster 17 for brain, Cluster 9 for cell lines, and Cluster 41 for single cells, indicating diverse functional roles such as glycosylation, cilium function, melanin biosynthesis, and mixed functions in adipocytes and endothelial cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), and [TFAP2C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7022). Each of these TFs, except TFAP2C, was shown to be regulating in 6 experiments, while TFAP2C was involved in 5 experiments.




The gene SLC27A3 has been associated with [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31562340) through genome-wide association studies.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, breast, and lung, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD33+ Myeloid cells, BDCA4+ Dendritic Cells, CD56+ NK Cells, CD14+ Monocytes, Whole Blood, Adipocytes, and Lung.



The mouse ortholog gene 26568 and its human ortholog gene 11000 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal retina blood vessel morphology, abnormal retina vasculature morphology, abnormal skin morphology, and decreased prepulse inhibition. Notably, these phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.041 (85.76th percentile), indicating a slightly hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -2.05 (43.01st percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.993 (16.88th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix and sheet structures, with affinities of 0.353 (76.49th percentile) and 0.360 (66.37th percentile), respectively, and a turn affinity of 0.281 (48.33rd percentile). The instability index is 42.80 (31.4th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.64 (45.18th percentile). The protein is 683 amino acids long (74.26th percentile) with a molecular weight of 73549.51 Da (72.74th percentile).
