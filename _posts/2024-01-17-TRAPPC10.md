The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829). It is involved in various processes including [endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006888), [intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006891), [vesicle coating](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006901), [early endosome to Golgi transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0034498), and [vesicle tethering](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0099022). Additionally, it is part of the [TRAPP complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030008) and the [TRAPPII protein complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990071).


The gene length is 48,131.0 base pairs (65.25% of all genes), the mature length is 2,572.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 44,882.5 base pairs.


TRAPPC10, with NCBI Gene ID 7109, has been mentioned in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TRAPPC10%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1997, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2000 to 2017. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top publications mentioning TRAPPC10, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include "[Biallelic variants in TRAPPC10 cause a microcephalic TRAPPopathy disorder in humans and mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35298461)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 1.6), "[Genetic interactions link ARF1, YPT31/32 and TRS130.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12210902)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 0.39), and "[The TRAPP Subunit Trs130p Interacts with the GAP Gyp6p to Mediate Ypt6p Dynamics at the Late Golgi.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27252941)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 0.32). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TRAPPC10](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000160218-TRAPPC10) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, implicated in various diseases including autism spectrum disorder, dwarfism, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in oligodendrocytes in the brain, leukemia cell lines, and NK-cells and T-cells in single-cell analyses. The gene is part of the non-specific transcription clusters in blood and tissue expression profiles.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various mental health conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, mood disorder, psychotic disorder, and schizoaffective disorder.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including the thyroid, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), CD14+ monocytes, and the small intestine.



The mouse ortholog gene 216131 and its human ortholog 7109 are associated with several phenotypic traits. Both sexes exhibit decreased bone mineral content, increased circulating alkaline phosphatase levels, increased mean platelet volume, and increased total body fat amount.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.263 (62.35th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -31.0 (5.86th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.999 (36.6th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 32.1% (51.2th percentile), 36.9% (72.11th percentile), and 27.6% (43.32th percentile), respectively.
