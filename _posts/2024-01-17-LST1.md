The gene is located in the [Golgi membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000139), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). It is involved in [cell morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000902), [immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006955), [regulation of cell shape](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008360), [anatomical structure morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009653), [dendrite development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016358), and [negative regulation of lymphocyte proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050672).


The gene length is 106,765 base pairs (83.13% of all genes), the mature length is 2,802 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 100,716 base pairs.


The gene LST1 (NCBI ID: 7940) has been mentioned in [17 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22LST1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1992 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1999 and 2012. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning LST1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Identification of a novel gene family encoding human liver-specific organic anion transporter LST-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10358072)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 10.41), "[Human liver-specific organic anion transporter, LST-1, mediates uptake of pravastatin by human hepatocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11356905)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 4.13), "[LST1 promotes the assembly of a molecular machinery responsible for tunneling nanotube formation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23239025)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 2.55), "[Lst1p and Sec24p cooperate in sorting of the plasma membrane ATPase into COPII vesicles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11086000)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 1.75), and "[Cloning and genomic characterization of LST1: a new gene in the human TNF region.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7590964)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 1.08). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[LST1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204482-LST1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the plasma membrane and cytosol. The gene is highly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, playing a role in the innate immune response. It is also expressed in lymphoid tissue and bone marrow, macrophages and microglia in the brain, and myeloid leukemia cell lines, all associated with immune response functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772), [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a variety of disease conditions, including integumentary system cancer, skin cancer, and skin melanoma. Additionally, the data highlights links to viral infectious diseases, specifically human immunodeficiency virus infectious disease. Other notable associations include lung cancer, respiratory system cancer, and diabetes mellitus, particularly type 1 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the data shows connections to rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis, suggesting a broad spectrum of disease conditions related to the integumentary, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as metabolic disorders.


The gene LST1 has been associated with [Body size at age 10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32376654), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Time](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013995) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung, blood, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in various tissues and cell types such as Heart, CD33+ Myeloid cells, BDCA4+ Dendritic Cells, CD56+ NK Cells, CD14+ Monocytes, Whole Blood, and Bone Marrow.




The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.3711 (49.69th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 1.65 at pH 7.0 (56.12th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.9955 (22.32nd percentile).
