The gene enables [calcium ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005509) and is active in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [dendrite](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030425), [terminal bouton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043195), and [synapse](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045202). It is located in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [gap junction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005921), and [parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0098688). The gene is involved in the [regulation of presynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0099509) and [regulation of long-term synaptic potentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1900271), enabling [calcium ion binding involved in regulation of presynaptic cytosolic calcium ion concentration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0099534).


The gene length is 68,586 base pairs (74.15th percentile), the mature length is 1,755 base pairs (45.83rd percentile), and the primary transcript length is 67,625 base pairs (81.75th percentile).


The gene CALB2, with NCBI ID 794, has been mentioned in [360 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CALB2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1961, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2000 and 2016.


The top five publications mentioning CALB2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Calretinin: a novel immunocytochemical marker for mesothelioma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8764740)" (1996) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 12.23, "[Local circuit neurons immunoreactive for calretinin, calbindin D-28k or parvalbumin in monkey prefrontal cortex: distribution and morphology.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8006226)" (1994) with an RCR of 10.53, "[Types of neurons, synaptic connections and chemical characteristics of cells immunoreactive for calbindin-D28K, parvalbumin and calretinin in the neocortex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9498163)" (1997) with an RCR of 10.13, "[Characterization of a polyclonal antiserum against the purified human recombinant calcium binding protein calretinin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8242719)" (1993) with an RCR of 7.49, and "[Cellular distribution of the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin in the neocortex of mammals: phylogenetic and developmental patterns.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10223310)" (1999) with an RCR of 7.28. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CALB2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000172137-CALB2) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many tissues. It is primarily located in the cytosol and is highly expressed in the cerebellum, contributing to nervous system development. In the brain, it is particularly active in the hindbrain, serving mixed functions. Additionally, CALB2 is expressed in squamous epithelial cells, where it is involved in keratinization, and in granulocytes, although its function in these cells is unknown. The gene is unprognostic for various cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma, among others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [REST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5978), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) and [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) were found to be regulating in 3 experiments each.



The input data indicates associations with various metabolic disorders, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, glucose metabolism diseases, diabetes mellitus, and specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus.



The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including adipose tissue, breast, brain, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in various brain regions such as the amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum, and cerebellum peduncles, as well as in the testis.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.688 (18.38th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -11.11 (20.78th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.012 (87.06th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (43.17%, 97.12th percentile), with lower affinities for sheet (31.37%, 35.93rd percentile) and turn (26.57%, 34.22nd percentile) structures. The instability index is 41.32 (26.45th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.06 (8.85th percentile). The protein is 271 amino acids long (24.57th percentile) with a molecular weight of 31539.52 Da (26.15th percentile).
