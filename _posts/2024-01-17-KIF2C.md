The gene is located in the [chromosome, centromeric region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000775) and colocalizes with the [kinetochore](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000776). It is also located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [microtubule cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015630), and [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). The gene is part of the [kinesin complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005871) and is active in the [centrosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005813), [spindle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005819), and [microtubule](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005874). It enables [microtubule motor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003777), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524), [microtubule binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008017), [ATP hydrolysis activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016887), [centromeric DNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019237), and [microtubule plus-end binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051010). The gene is involved in various processes including [microtubule-based movement](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007018), [microtubule depolymerization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007019), [mitotic metaphase chromosome alignment](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007080), [establishment or maintenance of microtubule cytoskeleton polarity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030951), [cell division](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051301), [metaphase chromosome alignment](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051310), [attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to kinetochore](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051315), and [regulation of chromosome segregation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051983).


The gene length is 205,311.0 base pairs (92.75% of all genes), the mature length is 4,768.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 107,531.5 base pairs.

[KIF2C](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142945-KIF2C) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, midbody, centrosome, and cytosol. KIF2C is associated with cell cycle regulation in T-regs and basic cellular processes in the testis. Its expression is also noted in late spermatids, although the function in this context is unknown.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), each with 6 experiments. Following these, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) was found in 5 experiments, while [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) and [BCL3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/602) were each identified in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including skin and blood. Additionally, it is expressed in several specific cell types and tissues such as 721_B_lymphoblasts, Leukemia_chronicMyelogenousK-562, CD71+_EarlyErythroid, Leukemialymphoblastic(MOLT-4), Testis, TestisIntersitial, and TestisGermCell.


The proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including the cell cycle, particularly the mitotic phase and its sub-phases such as anaphase, metaphase, and prometaphase. They also play roles in the separation and resolution of sister chromatids. Additionally, these proteins participate in the adaptive immune system, specifically in MHC class II antigen presentation, and are involved in hemostasis and the development of megakaryocytes and platelet production. Furthermore, they are associated with kinesins, which are crucial for intracellular transport and cell division.


The mouse ortholog gene 73804 and its human ortholog gene 11004 are associated with phenotypes including abnormal skin coloration and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, affecting both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.5044 (34.43rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 3.64 at pH 7.0 (63.27th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.008 (74.24th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 37.66% helix (87.57th percentile), 29.38% sheet (25.14th percentile), and 26.34% turn (32.25th percentile). Additionally, it has an instability index of 53.06 (66.82nd percentile), an isoelectric point of 8.03 (59.09th percentile), a length of 725 amino acids (76.83rd percentile), and a molecular weight of 81312.03 Da (76.98th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
