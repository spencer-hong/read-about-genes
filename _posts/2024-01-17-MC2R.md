The gene enables [G protein-coupled receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004930), [melanocortin receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004977), [corticotropin receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004978), and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), where it is also located. The gene is involved in the [G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007186), specifically the [G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, coupled to cyclic nucleotide second messenger](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007187) and the [adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007189). Additionally, it plays a role in the [neuropeptide signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007218) and the [regulation of metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019222).


The gene has a length of 4852 base pairs (13.54% of all genes), a mature length of 986 base pairs, and a primary transcript length of 4852 base pairs.


The gene MC2R (NCBI ID: 4158) has been mentioned in [136 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MC2R%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1971 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1998 and 2011. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning MC2R, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that have significantly contributed to the understanding of the gene's role in various biological processes. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable publications include [Mutations in MRAP, encoding a new interacting partner of the ACTH receptor, cause familial glucocorticoid deficiency type 2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15654338) (2005) (relative citation ratio: 6.62), [ACTH receptor, CYP11A1, CYP17 and CYP21A2 genes are expressed in skin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8675607) (1996) (relative citation ratio: 5.02), [Familial glucocorticoid deficiency associated with point mutation in the adrenocorticotropin receptor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8094489) (1993) (relative citation ratio: 4.37), [Regulation of corticotropin receptor number and messenger RNA in cultured human adrenocortical cells by corticotropin and angiotensin II.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8163681) (1994) (relative citation ratio: 3.96), and [Major pharmacological distinction of the ACTH receptor from other melanocortin receptors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8761313) (1996) (relative citation ratio: 3.87).

[MC2R](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000185231-MC2R) is a G-protein coupled receptor with evidence at the protein level, involved in diseases and is an FDA-approved drug target. It is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in the adrenal gland related to steroid metabolism. In the brain, it is non-specifically expressed and associated with mRNA splicing and the cell cycle. Additionally, MC2R is found in late spermatids, playing a role in spermatogenesis.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, [GATA3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2625) with 2 experiments, [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) with 2 experiments, [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 2 experiments, and [SS18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6760) with 2 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, and broader categories such as disease and disease of anatomical entity.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the pituitary and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), heart, adrenal cortex, adrenal gland, dorsal root ganglion, and uterus corpus.


The input data highlights various pathways and processes involving proteins, including g alpha (s) signalling events, class a/1 (rhodopsin-like receptors), defective acth causing obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (pomcd), gpcr ligand binding, metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes, peptide ligand-binding receptors, disease, gpcr downstream signaling, signaling by gpcr, and signal transduction.
