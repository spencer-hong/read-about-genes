The gene enables [DNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003677) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), including [identical protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042802). It is involved in [endosome to lysosome transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008333), the [Wnt signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016055), and the [negative regulation of Wnt signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030178). Additionally, it is part of the [NURF complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016589).


The gene length is 60,804 base pairs (71.33% of all genes), the mature length is 3,081 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 31,430 base pairs.


The gene HMGXB4 (NCBI ID: 10042) has been mentioned in [2 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22HMGXB4%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2008, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2009.


The top publications mentioning HMGXB4 include "[Gene-based SNP mapping of a psychotic bipolar affective disorder linkage region on 22q12.3: association with HMG2L1 and TOM1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17671966)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 0.4) and "[Repression of smooth muscle differentiation by a novel high mobility group box-containing protein, HMG2L1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20511232)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 0.39). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[HMGXB4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100281-HMGXB4) is a DNA-binding protein involved in cancer-related genes, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 42 for vesicular transport in blood, Cluster 40 for transcription in tissues, Cluster 28 for mixed function in the brain, Cluster 66 for mitochondria in cell lines, and Cluster 6 for transcription in ovarian stromal cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 6 experiments, [ME3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10873) with 5 experiments, [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) with 4 experiments, [TEAD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7003) with 3 experiments, and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cancer, particularly lung and respiratory system cancers, as well as organ system cancer. Additionally, there are links to cardiovascular system diseases such as coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and arteriosclerosis. Metabolic disorders, specifically inherited metabolic disorders and lipid metabolism disorders, are also implicated. Furthermore, the data highlights cognitive and mental health disorders, including bipolar disorder and mood disorders.


The HMGXB4 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595370) and [Hip circumference adjusted for BMI](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25673412), with the closest MeSH match being [Adaptation, Psychological](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000223) identified using [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0). Additionally, associations have been found with [Waist-hip ratio](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30575882), directly matching the MeSH term [Waist-Hip Ratio](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D049629), and [Waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30575882), with the closest MeSH match being [Adaptation, Psychological](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000223). Furthermore, the gene is associated with [Waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25673412), with the closest MeSH match being [Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020481).


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including ovary, 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, placenta, leukemia lymphoblastic cells (MOLT-4), and testis germ cells.
