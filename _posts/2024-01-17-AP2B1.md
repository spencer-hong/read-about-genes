[AP2B1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000006125-AP2B1) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in vesicles. AP2B1 is part of Cluster 33 in blood expression, which is non-specific and related to ATP binding. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 24, associated with the parathyroid gland and vesicular transport. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 14, linked to neurons and synaptic function. Additionally, AP2B1 is found in Cluster 27 in breast cancer cell lines, although its function in this context is unknown. In single-cell expression, it is part of Cluster 63, related to late spermatids and spermatogenesis.
