The gene length is 24,902 base pairs (47.62% of all genes), the mature length is 13,089 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 15,952 base pairs (45.73% of all genes).


The gene USO1 (NCBI ID: 8615) has been mentioned in [59 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22USO1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning USO1 is 1995, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2001 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning USO1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Molecular mechanism and species specificity of TAP inhibition by herpes simplex virus ICP47.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8670825)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 5.17), "[A mechanism of viral immune evasion revealed by cryo-EM analysis of the TAP transporter.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26789246)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 3.34), "[Gait apraxia evaluation in normal pressure hydrocephalus using inertial sensors. Clinical correlates, ventriculoperitoneal shunt outcomes, and tap-test predictive capacity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35739555)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 2.79), "[Can the radiological scale "iNPH Radscale" predict tap test response in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33278661)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 2.69), and "[Assembly of the ER to Golgi SNARE complex requires Uso1p.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8603910)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 2.68). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[USO1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000138768-USO1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is localized in the nucleoli fibrillar center and Golgi apparatus. The gene is part of Cluster 5 in blood expression, which is associated with non-specific cell proliferation, and Cluster 19 in tissue expression, linked to basic cellular processes. In the brain, it belongs to Cluster 50, involved in nucleic acid binding, and in cell lines, it is part of Cluster 22, associated with mRNA splicing and the cell cycle. Additionally, USO1 is found in Cluster 77 of single-cell expression, which is specific to plasma cells and protein processing.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [GATA3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2625), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), [TRIM28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10155), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), and [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including iris disease, uveal disease, cardiovascular system disease, nervous system disease, eye and adnexa disease, eye disease, and sensory system disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, blood vessel, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in pineal gland (both day and night), 721 B lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, and smooth muscle.


The proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including mitotic prophase, the cell cycle, and the M phase. Additionally, they participate in the reorganization of the Golgi cisternae pericentriolar stack.


The mouse ortholog gene 56041 and its human ortholog 8615 are associated with several phenotypes, including increased body length, increased total retina thickness, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.
