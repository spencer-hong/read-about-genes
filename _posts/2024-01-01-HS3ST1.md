The gene [None](https://www.proteinatlas.org/None-None) functions as a transferase and is detected in many tissues at the RNA level. It is primarily localized in vesicles and is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 8 in blood (Plasmacytoid DCs - Unknown function), Cluster 64 in tissues (Neuronal - Transcription), Cluster 35 in the brain (Non-specific - DNA binding), Cluster 53 in cell lines (Squamous epithelial cells - Keratinization), and Cluster 6 in single cells (Ovarian stromal cells - Transcription). Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.
