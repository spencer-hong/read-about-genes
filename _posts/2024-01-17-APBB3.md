[APBB3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000113108-APBB3) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in nuclear bodies, actin filaments, and the cytosol. APBB3 is expressed in dendritic cells with unknown function (Cluster 2) and is notably involved in nervous system development in the cerebellum (Cluster 65). In the brain, it is associated with neurons and synapses, contributing to synaptic function (Cluster 52). Additionally, APBB3 is expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines, playing a role in neuronal signaling (Cluster 17), and in spermatocytes, involved in spermatogenesis (Cluster 31).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019) with 6 experiments, followed by [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [HIF1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3091), [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908), and [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772), each with 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including male reproductive organ cancer, reproductive organ cancer, prostate cancer, cancer in general, diseases of cellular proliferation, organ system cancer, and disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary and thyroid, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland during the day, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, whole brain, spinal cord, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and olfactory bulb.



The mouse ortholog gene 225372 and its human ortholog gene 10307 are associated with phenotypic traits including increased basophil cell number and increased eosinophil cell number, with these effects observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.163 (72.81 percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -6.54 (29.53 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.999 (36.94 percentile). The protein has a length of 486 amino acids (56.58 percentile) and a molecular weight of 52584.52 Da (54.57 percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 31.69% for helix (47.6 percentile), 30.25% for sheet (29.66 percentile), and 32.51% for turn (79.42 percentile). The instability index is 47.38 (47.86 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.97 (29.7 percentile). These values were calculated using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
