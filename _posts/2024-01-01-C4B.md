The gene length is 1,173,676.0 base pairs (99.76% of all genes), the mature length is 1,825.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 861,116.5 base pairs (99.82% of all genes).


The gene C4B, with NCBI ID 721, has been the subject of [203 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22C4B%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1975, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1988 and 2005.


The top five publications mentioning C4B, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Family study of the major histocompatibility complex in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: importance of null alleles of C4A and C4B in determining disease susceptibility](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6401549)" (1983) (relative citation ratio: 10.44), "[Human C4-binding protein. II. Role in proteolysis of C4b by C3b-inactivator](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/702059)" (1978) (relative citation ratio: 9.22), "[Complement system proteins which interact with C3b or C4b A superfamily of structurally related proteins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25290405)" (1986) (relative citation ratio: 6.27), "[Visualization of human C4b-binding protein and its complexes with vitamin K-dependent protein S and complement protein C4b](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6222381)" (1983) (relative citation ratio: 5.26), and "[Targeting C3b/C4b and VEGF with a bispecific fusion protein optimized for neovascular age-related macular degeneration therapy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35648811)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 4.76). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [ACBG2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134883-ACBG2) functions as a blood group antigen and is an FDA-approved drug target involved in systemic lupus erythematosus. Evidence supports its expression at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the liver, where it is associated with metabolism (Cluster 83). In the brain, it is expressed in astrocytes with mixed functions (Cluster 39). Additionally, the gene is expressed in the DU4475 cell line and hepatocytes, where it is involved in metabolism (Cluster 62).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [AGO2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/27161), and [RBFOX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23543), each shown to be regulating in one experiment.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.253 (63.52 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -2.654 (40.75 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.0001 (42.03 percentile). The protein has a predicted secondary structure with 31.48% helix (45.55 percentile), 35.32% sheet (61.46 percentile), and 29.24% turn (57.97 percentile) affinities. The instability index is 45.99 (42.9 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.77 (47.51 percentile). The protein is 1744 amino acids long (96.48 percentile) with a molecular weight of 192766.16 Da (96.39 percentile).
