The gene length is 828,410 base pairs (99.38% of all genes), the mature length is 13,211 base pairs (99.66% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 708,162.5 base pairs (99.67% of all genes).


The gene SUOX, with NCBI ID 6821, has been the subject of [73 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SUOX%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1976, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2014.


The top five publications mentioning SUOX, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Molecular basis of sulfite oxidase deficiency from the structure of sulfite oxidase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9428520)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 8.59), "[Purification and properties of sulfite oxidase from human liver.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/956383)" (1976) (relative citation ratio: 4.55), "[Hierarchical porous MoS<sub>2</sub> particles: excellent multi-enzyme-like activities, mechanism and its sensitive phenol sensing based on inhibition of sulfite oxidase mimics.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915296)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 3.09), "[Molybdenum trioxide nanoparticles with intrinsic sulfite oxidase activity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24702461)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 2.68), and "[Human sulfite oxidase R160Q: identification of the mutation in a sulfite oxidase-deficient patient and expression and characterization of the mutant enzyme.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9600976)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 2.43). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[Oxidoreductase](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) is a gene with oxidoreductase molecular function and evidence at the protein level. It is implicated in disease variants associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability. The gene is detected in all RNA tissues and is particularly expressed in the liver and kidney, where it plays a role in metabolism. It is also expressed in oligodendrocytes in the brain and in eosinophils in the blood, although its function in these cell types is less clear. In single-cell expression analysis, it is found in hepatocytes, again suggesting a role in metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 6 experiments, followed by [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), each with 5 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 211389 and its human ortholog gene 6821 are associated with the phenotype 'no spontaneous movement', observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.339 (53.46th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -12.92 (18.06th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.999 (37.18th percentile), with a secondary structure composition of 27.71% helix (15.38th percentile), 35.05% sheet (59.49th percentile), and 30.46% turn (67.2nd percentile). The instability index is 41.82 (28.11th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.72 (23.34th percentile). The protein has a length of 545 amino acids (63.63rd percentile) and a molecular weight of 60282.28 Da (63.05th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
