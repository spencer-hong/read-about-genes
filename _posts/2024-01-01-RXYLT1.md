[None](https://www.proteinatlas.org/None-None) is a transferase involved in several diseases, including congenital muscular dystrophy, dystroglycanopathy, and lissencephaly. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized in the nucleoplasm and Golgi apparatus. It is expressed in eosinophils with unknown function (Cluster 19) and is involved in flagellum assembly in spermatids (Cluster 74). In cell lines, it is expressed in neuronal cells related to sensory perception (Cluster 11), and in single cells, it is found in early spermatids with unknown function (Cluster 18).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), and [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 216395, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 10329, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal coat/hair pigmentation, impaired righting response, limb grasping, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. All these phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.313, indicating a hydrophilic nature (56.57th percentile). It exhibits a charge of 5.34 at pH 7.0 (69.16th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.996 (25.06th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 32.28% helix (53.09th percentile), 38.60% sheet (81.37th percentile), and 25.51% turn (25.25th percentile). The instability index is 44.60 (37.77th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.57 (68.08th percentile). The protein has a length of 443 amino acids (51.04th percentile) and a molecular weight of 51145.14 Da (52.96th percentile).
