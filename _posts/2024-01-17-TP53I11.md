The gene is located in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020) and is involved in the [negative regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008285).


The gene length is 10,325 base pairs (26.45% of all genes), the mature length is 755 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 7,668 base pairs.


The gene TP53I11 (NCBI ID: 9537) has been mentioned in [8 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TP53I11%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2004, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2019.


The gene TP53I11 has been extensively studied in various contexts, with notable publications highlighting its role in cellular processes and cancer biology. The top five publications mentioning TP53I11 include "[Loss of TP53I11 Enhances the Extracellular Matrix-independent Survival by Promoting Activation of AMPK.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30376610)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 0.62), "[MiR-645 promotes proliferation and migration of non-small cell lung cancer cells by targeting TP53I11.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32572880)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.55), "[PIG11 over-expression predicts good prognosis and induces HepG2 cell apoptosis via reactive oxygen species-dependent mitochondrial pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30241046)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.39), "[PIG11 is involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis and its over-expression promotes Hepg2 cell apoptosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19096915)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 0.37), and "[A P53 target gene, PIG11, contributes to chemosensitivity of cells to arsenic trioxide.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15225615)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 0.34). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TP53I11](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000175274-TP53I11) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, acrosome, and principal piece. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 38 in monocytes and neutrophils related to degranulation, Cluster 7 in adipose tissue with mixed function, Cluster 10 in the cerebellum associated with nucleic acid binding, Cluster 17 in neuroblastoma involved in neuronal signaling, and Cluster 36 in late spermatids with unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [REST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5978) with 6 experiments, [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 5 experiments, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 5 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 5 experiments, and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including breast and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, heart, cerebellum peduncles, and skeletal muscle.



The mouse ortholog gene 277414 and its human ortholog gene 9537 are associated with the phenotype of increased circulating creatinine level, observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.386 (93.43rd percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity. The charge at pH 7.0 is 6.673 (73.26th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.983 (6.24th percentile). The protein has a notable affinity for helix (0.344, 70.73rd percentile) and sheet (0.466, 95.91st percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (0.222, 7.14th percentile).
