The gene is located in the [cornified envelope](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001533), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), [gap junction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005921), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062), and [ficolin-1-rich granule membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0101003). It is active in the [desmosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030057) and enables [calcium ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005509) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). Additionally, the gene is involved in [homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007156) and [cell-cell adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0098609).


The gene length is 621,800 base pairs (98.93% of all genes), the mature length is 1,552.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 586,993 base pairs.


The gene DSC1 (NCBI ID: 1823) has been mentioned in [22 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DSC1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1993 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2004 and 2016.

[DSC1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134765-DSC1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, and it is notably expressed in skin, neurons, and squamous epithelial cells, where it is involved in cornification, mixed function, and keratinization, respectively. In blood, it is part of a non-specific cluster related to transcription and translation. The gene is unprognostic in several cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma (validation), Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and Skin Cutaneous Melanoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, followed by [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), each with 2 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, nervous system disease, central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, cognitive disorder, and disease of mental health.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the subthalamic nucleus, appendix, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscle, and skin.
