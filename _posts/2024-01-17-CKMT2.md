The gene enables [creatine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004111), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524). It is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739) and the [mitochondrial inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005743), where it is also active. The gene is involved in [muscle contraction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006936), [phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016310), and the [phosphocreatine biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046314).


The gene length is 31,125 base pairs (53.71% of all genes), the mature length is 4,349 base pairs (86.64% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 15,723 base pairs (45.3% of all genes).


CKMT2 (Gene NCBI ID: 1160) has been mentioned in [5 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CKMT2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1991, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 1999.


The top 5 publications mentioning CKMT2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Free radical-induced inactivation of creatine kinase: influence on the octameric and dimeric states of the mitochondrial enzyme (Mib-CK).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10567223)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 1.25), "[Regulatory element analysis and structural characterization of the human sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1917943)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 0.75), "[Oxidative myocytes of heart and skeletal muscle express abundant sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10462222)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 0.4), "[Elements regulating cardiomyocyte expression of the human sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase gene in transgenic mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9312135)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 0.25), and "[Purification and characterization of human sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9152853)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 0.16). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CKMT2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000131730-CKMT2) is a kinase and transferase with evidence at the protein level, and it is an FDA-approved drug target. The gene is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in heart muscle, where it is involved in cardiac muscle contraction. It is also expressed in endothelial cells, contributing to vasculature, and in stomach and colon cancer cell lines, associated with digestion. Additionally, CKMT2 is found in cardiomyocytes, playing a role in muscle contraction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cognitive disorders, diseases of mental health, and reproductive system diseases. Specifically, prostate diseases such as prostatic hypertrophy and male reproductive system diseases are highlighted.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, muscle, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, thyroid, fetal thyroid, adrenal gland, skeletal muscle, and tongue.


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in metabolism, including creatine metabolism and the metabolism of amino acids and their derivatives.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.419 (43.87th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 4.26 at pH 7.0 (65.55th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.999 (37.98th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 30.1% helix (32.59th percentile), 35.8% sheet (64.9th percentile), and 28.2% turn (48.79th percentile). The instability index is 36.75 (13.61th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.46 (65.78th percentile). The protein has a length of 419 amino acids (47.96th percentile) and a molecular weight of 47503.94 Da (48.94th percentile).
