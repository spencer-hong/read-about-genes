The gene length is 25,789 base pairs (48.51% of all genes), the mature length is 582 base pairs (4.52% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 10,872 base pairs (35.52% of all genes).


The gene RAB6A (NCBI ID: 5870) has been mentioned in [96 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RAB6A%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1992, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2000 and 2015.


The top five publications mentioning RAB6A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Early/recycling endosomes-to-TGN transport involves two SNARE complexes and a Rab6 isoform.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11839770)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 6.97), "[Interaction of a Golgi-associated kinesin-like protein with Rab6.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9438855)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 6.78), "[Rab6 coordinates a novel Golgi to ER retrograde transport pathway in live cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10562278)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 5.87), "[The small GTP-binding protein rab6 functions in intra-Golgi transport.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7798313)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 3.75), and "[Rab and Arl GTPase family members cooperate in the localization of the golgin GCC185.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18243103)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 2.52). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RAB6A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000175582-RAB6A) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and basal body. The gene is part of Cluster 42 in blood expression, which is associated with non-specific vesicular transport. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 61, indicating a role in brain neuronal signaling. Additionally, RAB6A is part of Cluster 52 in brain expression, suggesting involvement in synaptic function. The gene is also found in Cluster 24 of cell line expression, with an unknown function, and Cluster 4 of single-cell expression, specifically in extravillous trophoblasts.
