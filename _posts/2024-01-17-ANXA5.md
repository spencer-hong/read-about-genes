ANXA5 (gene NCBI ID: 308) has been mentioned in [773 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ANXA5%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning ANXA5 is 1953, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2013.


The top 5 publications mentioning ANXA5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A novel assay for apoptosis. Flow cytometric detection of phosphatidylserine expression on early apoptotic cells using fluorescein labelled Annexin V.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7622868)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 110.08), "[Annexin V for flow cytometric detection of phosphatidylserine expression on B cells undergoing apoptosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8068938)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 51.83), "[Annexin V-affinity assay: a review on an apoptosis detection system based on phosphatidylserine exposure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9450519)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 29.58), "[Quantitation of Apoptosis and Necrosis by Annexin V Binding, Propidium Iodide Uptake, and Flow Cytometry.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27803250)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 11.29), and "[Human neutrophils lose their surface Fc gamma RIII and acquire Annexin V binding sites during apoptosis in vitro.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7812008)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 9.32). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ANXA5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000164111-ANXA5) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, known for its involvement in FDA-approved drug targets. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily located in the nuclear membrane. ANXA5 is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, playing a role in degranulation, and is also involved in the extracellular matrix organization of connective tissue. Additionally, it is associated with metabolism in the brain and is expressed in macrophages, contributing to the innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMAD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4089), [RUNX1T1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/862), [EGR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1958), [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829), and [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including various forms of cancer such as leukemia, hematologic cancer, immune system cancer, and organ system cancer. Specific types of leukemia mentioned include acute leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoblastic leukemia. Additionally, the data highlights respiratory conditions like obstructive lung disease, lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cardiovascular issues are also noted, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, and hypertension. Neurological disorders such as nervous system disease, central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and motor neuron disease are also present in the data.



The gene is expressed in adipose tissue and skin according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, adipocytes, smooth muscle, and placenta.
