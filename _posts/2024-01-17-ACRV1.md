The gene is located in the [acrosomal vesicle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001669) and enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is involved in [spermatogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007283).


The gene length is 45,380 base pairs (63.76% of all genes), the mature length is 1,786.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 41,093 base pairs.


The gene ACRV1 (NCBI ID: 56) has been mentioned in [14 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ACRV1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1990, with the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1993 and 1995.


The top five publications mentioning ACRV1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Identification of human acrosomal antigen SP-10 in primates and pigs.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2337631)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 1.94), "[Localization of sperm antigen SP-10 during the six stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium in man.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1868140)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 1.61), "[Human SP-10: acrosomal distribution, processing, and fate after the acrosome reaction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7888499)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 1.58), "[Stage-specific detection of mRNA for the sperm antigen SP-10 in human testes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8379586)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 0.81), and "[Complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cloning and characterization of mSP-10: the mouse homologue of human acrosomal protein SP-10.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8547483)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 0.8). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ACRV1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134940-ACRV1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, primarily localized in the acrosome. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in the testis during spermatogenesis (Cluster 42) and the cerebral cortex (Cluster 32). Additionally, it is expressed in early spermatids during spermatogenesis (Cluster 21) and in the RS4;11 cell line. The gene's prognostic value in cancer is unprognostic for Breast Invasive Carcinoma and Glioblastoma Multiforme.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 4 experiments, [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 3 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) and [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) each with 2 experiments, and [TLE3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7090) with 1 experiment.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, cardiac myocytes, appendix, and multiple regions of the testis such as the interstitial tissue, Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and germ cells.




The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.724 (16.07th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of -24.38 at pH 7.0 (8.42nd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.018 (95.25th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 30.19% helix (33.69th percentile), 21.89% sheet (3.5th percentile), and 36.98% turn (93.63rd percentile). The instability index is 37.65 (15.75th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 4.68 (2.86th percentile). The protein has a length of 265 amino acids (23.78th percentile) and a molecular weight of 28156.22 Da (22.09th percentile).
