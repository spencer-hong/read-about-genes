The gene is located in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and is part of the [troponin complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005861). Additionally, it is involved in the [transition between fast and slow fiber](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0014883), [sarcomere organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045214), and [negative regulation of muscle contraction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045932).


The gene length is 4,321 base pairs (12.18% of all genes), the mature length is 832.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 2,803 base pairs.


The gene TNNT1 (NCBI ID: 7138) has been mentioned in [235 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TNNT1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1978, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning TNNT1, ranked by their scientific influence, include [Carboplatin in BRCA1/2-mutated and triple-negative breast cancer BRCAness subgroups: the TNT Trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29713086) (2018) (relative citation ratio: 22.15), [Relation between troponin T and the risk of subsequent cardiac events in unstable coronary artery disease. The FRISC study group.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8653870) (1996) (relative citation ratio: 14.86), [RNA demethylase ALKBH5 prevents pancreatic cancer progression by posttranscriptional activation of PER1 in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32429928) (2020) (relative citation ratio: 12.82), [S-troponin T in suspected ischemic myocardial injury compared with mass and catalytic concentrations of S-creatine kinase isoenzyme MB.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1868602) (1991) (relative citation ratio: 9.34), and [Effect of a single dose of the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab on inflammation and troponin T release in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27161611) (2016) (relative citation ratio: 8.61). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TNNT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105048-TNNT1) is a muscle protein with evidence at the protein level. It is involved in Nemaline myopathy and is detected in many tissues. The protein is localized in the nucleoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and cytosol. TNNT1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in muscle contraction, and is also expressed in astrocytes, contributing to astrocyte-neuron interactions. In blood, it is associated with eosinophils and protein ubiquitination. Additionally, TNNT1 is expressed in sarcoma cell lines and skeletal myocytes, further emphasizing its role in muscle contraction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [CNOT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4849), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046), and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.




The gene TNNT1 has been associated with the trait [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595370) through genome-wide association studies.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, muscle, and salivary gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the thyroid, chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), prostate, fetal thyroid, skeletal muscle, tongue, and testis.


The proteins are involved in pathways related to muscle contraction and striated muscle contraction.
