The gene enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723) and [RNA-3'-phosphate cyclase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003963), and is involved in [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524). It is active in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654). Additionally, the gene is involved in [RNA processing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006396) and the [negative regulation of optical nerve axon regeneration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1905592).


The gene length is 32,130 base pairs (54.57% of all genes), the mature length is 2,192 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 10,455 base pairs (34.47% of all genes).


The gene with NCBI ID 8634 has been mentioned in [13 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RTCA%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1983, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2016.


The top 5 publications mentioning RTCA, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Functional cardiotoxicity profiling and screening using the xCELLigence RTCA Cardio System.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22093298)" (2011) (RCR: 1.82), "[The human RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase is a member of a new family of proteins conserved in Eucarya, Bacteria and Archaea.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9184239)" (1997) (RCR: 1.51), "[RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase activity and RNA ligation in HeLa cell extract.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6828385)" (1983) (RCR: 1.29), "[Evaluation of the cytotoxic effect of Ly2109761 on HeLa cells using the xCELLigence RTCA system.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30655817)" (2019) (RCR: 0.57), and "[The cyclic phosphodiesterase CNP and RNA cyclase RtcA fine-tune noncanonical XBP1 splicing during ER stress.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30355738)" (2018) (RCR: 0.44). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RTCA](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137996-RTCA) is a ligase with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. RTCA is associated with non-specific expression clusters in various tissues, including blood (Cluster 33: Non-specific - ATP binding), general tissue (Cluster 35: Non-specific - Mitochondria), brain (Cluster 34: Non-specific - Mixed function), cell lines (Cluster 37: Non-specific - mRNA processing), and single cells (Cluster 39: Non-specific - Basic cellular processes).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 6 experiments, [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) each with 5 experiments, and [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980) and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) each with 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorders and diseases of mental health.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the adrenal gland, spleen, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji and Daudi), 721 B lymphoblasts, chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), smooth muscle, and bronchial epithelial cells.




The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.036 (85.56th percentile), indicating a slightly hydrophobic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of 1.99 (57.5th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.999 (35.33rd percentile), with a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 0.328 (57.53rd percentile), 0.355 (62.93rd percentile), and 0.270 (38.42nd percentile), respectively. The instability index is 33.55 (7.87th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.01 (58.93rd percentile). The protein is 366 amino acids long (40.59th percentile) with a molecular weight of 39336.31 Da (38.57th percentile).
