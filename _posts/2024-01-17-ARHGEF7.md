[ARHGEF7](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000102606-ARHGEF7) is a gene that functions as a guanine-nucleotide releasing factor. It is detected in all tissues at the RNA level and is particularly expressed in the cerebellum, where it is involved in nervous system development. In blood, ARHGEF7 is associated with eosinophils and transcription processes. At the single-cell level, it is found in smooth muscle cells, contributing to signal transduction. The protein has been validated with evidence at the protein level.

Furthermore, there are associations with kidney disease, urinary system disease, inherited metabolic disorder, and bilirubin metabolic disorder.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including breast, Lymphoma Burkitt's (Raji), 721 B lymphoblasts, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, prostate, fetal lung, thymus, and leukemia lymphoblastic (MOLT-4).


The input data highlights various pathways involving EGFR, including its downregulation, signaling in cancer, and overexpression in wild-type forms. Additionally, it covers signaling by EGFR variants, NGF, and Ephrin, as well as processes like axon guidance, developmental biology, and cell death signaling via NRAGE, NRIF, and NADE. Other notable pathways include p75 NTR receptor-mediated signaling, G alpha (12/13) signaling events, Rho GTPase cycle, and signaling by Rho GTPases. The data also encompasses broader categories such as disease, GPCR downstream signaling, signaling by GPCR, and general signal transduction.
