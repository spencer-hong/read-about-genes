The gene enables [GTPase activator activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005096) and [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872) molecular functions. It is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and located in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). Additionally, it is involved in [biological processes](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008150).


The gene length is 15,939 base pairs (36.43% of all genes), the mature length is 4,884.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 15,939 base pairs.


AGFG2 has been mentioned in [41 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22AGFG2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest mention in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2005 and 2015. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning AGFG2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Structural basis for the interaction between FxFG nucleoporin repeats and importin-beta in nuclear trafficking.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10929717)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 6.12), "[A nucleoporin is required for induction of Ca2+ spiking in legume nodule development and essential for rhizobial and fungal symbiosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16407163)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 4.74), "[CREB binding protein interacts with nucleoporin-specific FG repeats that activate transcription and mediate NUP98-HOXA9 oncogenicity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9858599)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 3.98), "[Nucleoporin-mediated regulation of cell identity genes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27807035)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 3.07), and "[Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus Rev and human T-cell leukemia virus Rex function, but not Mason-Pfizer monkey virus constitutive transport element activity, by a mutant human nucleoporin targeted to Crm1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9765402)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 2.49). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[AGFG2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000106351-AGFG2) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the cytosol and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 5 for non-specific cell proliferation in blood, Cluster 38 for salivary gland secretion in tissues, Cluster 51 for mixed function in the brain, Cluster 18 for liver cancer metabolism in cell lines, and Cluster 75 for salivary secretion in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) with 6 experiments, [AHR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/196) with 5 experiments, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 5 experiments, [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 5 experiments, and [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, salivary gland, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), liver, CD105+ endothelial cells, salivary gland, atrioventricular node, and dorsal root ganglion.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.227 (66.5th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 8.81 at pH 7.0 (78.84th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.01 (80.45th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 24.53% helix (4.27th percentile), 27.65% sheet (17.07th percentile), and 42.20% turn (98.44th percentile). The instability index is 58.74 (80.6th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.28 (86.59th percentile). The protein has a length of 481 amino acids (56.03rd percentile) and a molecular weight of 48962.48 Da (50.5th percentile).
