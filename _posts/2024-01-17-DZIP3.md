The gene is involved in [protein polyubiquitination](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000209) and enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723), [ubiquitin-protein transferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004842), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [phosphatase binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019902), [polyubiquitin modification-dependent protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031593), [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872), and [ubiquitin protein ligase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0061630). It is active and located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737).


The gene length is 17,405 base pairs (38.57% of all genes), the mature length is 1,164.5 base pairs (27.88% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 4,524.5 base pairs (16.84% of all genes).


DZIP3 has been mentioned in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DZIP3%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2003, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2012 to 2020.


The top publications mentioning DZIP3 include "[Blood Cell DNA Methylation of Aging-Related Ubiquitination Gene *DZIP3* Can Predict the Onset of Early Stage Colorectal Cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33330022)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.47), "[DZIP3 is a key factor to stratify IDH1 wild-type lower-grade gliomas.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33229627)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.38), "[hRUL138, a novel human RNA-binding RING-H2 ubiquitin-protein ligase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12538761)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 0.31), and "[Novel CARM1-Interacting Protein, DZIP3, Is a Transcriptional Coactivator of Estrogen Receptor-Î±.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26505218)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 0.28). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[DZIP3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198919-DZIP3) is a gene with molecular functions in RNA-binding and transferase activity. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in vesicles. DZIP3 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 24 for non-specific transcription in blood, Cluster 8 for ciliated cells and cilium organization in tissues, Cluster 17 for choroid plexus and cilium in the brain, Cluster 63 for non-specific protein processing in cell lines, and Cluster 42 for ciliated cells and cilium assembly in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 6 experiments, followed by [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [FOXM1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2305), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), each with 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including nervous system disease, refractive error, myopia, eye and adnexa disease, eye disease, and sensory system disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), pituitary, and multiple testicular tissues, including interstitial, Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and germ cells.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways related to the immune system, including antigen processing through ubiquitination and proteasome degradation, class I MHC-mediated antigen processing and presentation, and broader roles within the adaptive immune system and the overall immune system.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.508 (34.14th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -6.11 (30.69th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.005 (65.96th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix (0.351, 75.32nd percentile) and sheet (0.341, 52.77th percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (0.269, 37.16th percentile). The instability index is 55.69 (73.95th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.45 (41.46th percentile). The protein is 1208 amino acids long (91.82nd percentile) with a molecular weight of 138602.65 Da (92.51st percentile).
