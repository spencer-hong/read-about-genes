The gene length is 634,510 base pairs (98.98% of all genes), the mature length is 5,195 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 434,181 base pairs (99.01% of all genes).


The gene CSNK1G3 (NCBI ID: 1456) has been the subject of [2 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CSNK1G3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2014.


The top publications mentioning CSNK1G3 include "[Cloning and chromosome mapping of the human casein kinase I gamma3 gene (CSNK1G3).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9925945)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 0.13) and "[Intratumoral heterogeneity of CSNK1G3 mutations, a casein kinase 1, in colon cancers.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32241596)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.06). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725) and [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.








The mouse ortholog gene 70425 and its human ortholog 1456 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Notably, the mouse model exhibits an abnormal auditory brainstem response, which is not observed in both sexes. Additionally, there are systemic alterations, including decreased circulating alkaline phosphatase levels, decreased erythrocyte cell numbers, and increased circulating LDL cholesterol levels, all of which are observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.748 (14.55th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 15.87 at pH 7.0 (89.92nd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.005 (65.59th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 30.87% for helix (39.72nd percentile), 31.77% for sheet (38.19th percentile), and 28.86% for turn (54.8th percentile). The instability index is 38.03 (16.9th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.29 (86.75th percentile). The protein has a length of 447 amino acids (51.55th percentile) and a molecular weight of 51387.93 Da (53.2nd percentile).
