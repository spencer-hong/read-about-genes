The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is located in both the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062).


The gene length is 533.0 base pairs (0.55 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 533.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 533.0 base pairs.


The gene UBL3 (NCBI ID: 5412) has been mentioned in [30 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22UBL3%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1968 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1997 and 2007. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning UBL3, ranked by their relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows: ["Target immunity of Mu transposition reflects a differential distribution of Mu B protein."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2965985) (1988) (relative citation ratio: 2.11), ["Typing of intimin (eae) genes from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) isolated from children with diarrhoea in Montevideo, Uruguay: identification of two novel intimin variants (muB and xiR/beta2B)."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16914645) (2006) (relative citation ratio: 1.99), ["MuB protein allosterically activates strand transfer by the transposase of phage Mu."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1646076) (1991) (relative citation ratio: 1.62), ["Stimulation of the Mu A protein-mediated strand cleavage reaction by the Mu B protein, and the requirement of DNA nicking for stable type 1 transpososome formation. In vitro transposition characteristics of mini-Mu plasmids carrying terminal base pair mutations."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1847140) (1991) (relative citation ratio: 1.07), and ["The sequence and phylogenetic analysis of avian reovirus genome segments M1, M2, and M3 encoding the minor core protein muA, the major outer capsid protein muB, and the nonstructural protein muNS."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16337282) (2006) (relative citation ratio: 1.03).

[UBL3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000122042-UBL3) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the centrosome and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 9 in T-regs for blood expression, Cluster 9 in oligodendrocytes for tissue expression, Cluster 28 in oligodendrocytes for brain expression, Cluster 9 in skin cancer for cell line expression, and Cluster 29 in monocytes for single cell expression. The gene's prognostic significance in various cancers is unprognostic.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 3 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 3 experiments, and [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774) with 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including cancer, diseases of cellular proliferation, cardiovascular system diseases, cognitive disorders, mental health disorders, developmental disorders of mental health, specific developmental disorders, communication disorders, language disorders, speech disorders, learning disabilities, and reading disorders.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the cervix uteri, brain, and stomach, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), amygdala, caudate nucleus, spinal cord, and occipital lobe.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.332 (54.23rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -1.24 (45.8th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.005 (62.55th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 30.8% (38.63rd percentile), 35.0% (59.48th percentile), and 32.5% (79.24th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 56.2 (75.06th percentile), suggesting potential instability. The isoelectric point is 6.27 (37.38th percentile), with a molecular weight of 13156.9 Da (4.51st percentile). The sequence length is 117 amino acids (4.34th percentile).
