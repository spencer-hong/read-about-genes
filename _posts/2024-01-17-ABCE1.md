The gene length is 126,176 base pairs (86.09% of all genes), the mature length is 2,654 base pairs (66.88% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 10,198 base pairs (33.8% of all genes).


The gene ABCE1 (NCBI ID: 6059) has been mentioned in [70 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ABCE1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1986 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2008 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning ABCE1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The role of ABCE1 in eukaryotic posttermination ribosomal recycling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20122402)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 5.23, "[Dissociation by Pelota, Hbs1 and ABCE1 of mammalian vacant 80S ribosomes and stalled elongation complexes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21448132)" (2011) with a relative citation ratio of 4.48, "[Cloning and characterization of a RNAse L inhibitor. A new component of the interferon-regulated 2-5A pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7539425)" (1995) with a relative citation ratio of 3.98, "[Biogenesis of cytosolic ribosomes requires the essential iron-sulphur protein Rli1p and mitochondria.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15660134)" (2005) with a relative citation ratio of 3.68, and "[Ribosome recycling depends on a mechanistic link between the FeS cluster domain and a conformational switch of the twin-ATPase ABCE1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21292982)" (2011) with a relative citation ratio of 2.74. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ABCE1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000164163-ABCE1) is a gene with molecular functions as a chaperone and hydrolase, supported by evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is primarily located in the cytosol. ABCE1 is part of blood expression cluster 33, which is non-specific and involved in ATP binding, and tissue expression cluster 35, which is non-specific and related to mitochondria. In the brain, it is part of cluster 28, associated with oligodendrocytes and mixed functions. Additionally, ABCE1 is found in cell line expression cluster 22, which is non-specific and involved in mRNA splicing and the cell cycle, and single cell expression cluster 39, which is non-specific and related to basic cellular processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774) and [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including skin, pineal gland (both day and night), B lymphoblasts (721), promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Daudi), CD105+ endothelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells, and lymphoblastic leukemia cells (MOLT-4).



The mouse ortholog gene 24015, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 6059, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal seminal vesicle morphology, decreased prepulse inhibition, embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, enlarged lymph nodes, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. Notably, decreased prepulse inhibition, enlarged lymph nodes, and preweaning lethality are observed in both sexes, while abnormal seminal vesicle morphology and embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis are not.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.191 (70.11th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 9.191 (79.91st percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.0002 (42.54th percentile). The protein has a predicted affinity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 33.22% (61.26th percentile), 37.06% (73.48th percentile), and 26.04% (29.59th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 33.99 (8.53rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.63 (69.41st percentile). The protein is 599 amino acids long (68.51st percentile) with a molecular weight of 67313.58 Da (68.75th percentile).
