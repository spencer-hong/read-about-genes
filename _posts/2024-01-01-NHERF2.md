The gene length is 501,413 base pairs (98.37% of all genes), the mature length is 2,007 base pairs (52.89% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 500,310 base pairs (99.24% of all genes).


The gene NHERF2 (NCBI ID: 9351) has been the subject of [32 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NHERF2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2013.


The top five publications mentioning NHERF2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein E3KARP binds the epithelial brush border Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 and the cytoskeletal protein ezrin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9748260)" (1998) with a relative citation ratio of 4.99, "[E3KARP mediates the association of ezrin and protein kinase A with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in airway cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10893422)" (2000) with a relative citation ratio of 3.26, "[D-glucose acts via sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 to increase NHE3 in mouse jejunal brush border by a Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor 2-dependent process.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20977906)" (2011) with a relative citation ratio of 2.01, "[Oligomerization of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 PDZ domains: differential regulation by association with receptor carboxyl-termini and by phosphorylation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11456497)" (2001) with a relative citation ratio of 1.79, and "[The down regulated in adenoma (dra) gene product binds to the second PDZ domain of the NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein (E3KARP), potentially linking intestinal Cl-/HCO3- exchange to Na+/H+ exchange.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12369822)" (2002) with a relative citation ratio of 1.66. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 6 experiments, [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 5 experiments, [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 5 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 5 experiments, and [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





NHERF2 has been associated with various traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Cardiovascular disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595370), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Cardiovascular Diseases](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D002318) via a synonym direct match. Additionally, associations have been found with [Diastolic blood pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27841878) and [Systolic blood pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27841878), both mapping to the MeSH term [Pressure](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011312) through embedding matches. Other hematological traits such as [Hematocrit](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888493), [Hemoglobin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), and [Red blood cell count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595370) have also been identified, mapping to their respective MeSH terms [Hematocrit](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006400), [Hemoglobins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006454), and [Erythrocyte Count](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004906) through various direct and embedding matches. These associations highlight the multifaceted role of NHERF2 in both cardiovascular and hematological systems.


The mouse ortholog gene 65962 and its human ortholog 9351 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities, including decreased erythrocyte cell number, decreased hematocrit, decreased hemoglobin content, increased circulating alkaline phosphatase level, and increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.896 (7.53rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 1.69 at pH 7.0 (56.3rd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.012 (85.28th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 31.45% helix (45.33rd percentile) and 24.63% sheet (7.91st percentile), with 31.45% turn (73.53rd percentile). The instability index is 54.78 (71.59th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 7.80 (57.07th percentile).
