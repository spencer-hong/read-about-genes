The gene length is 533.0 base pairs (0.55 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 533.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 533.0 base pairs.


The gene UBL3 has an NCBI Gene ID of 5412. It has been featured in [30 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22UBL3%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1968, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2007.


The top five publications mentioning UBL3, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Target immunity of Mu transposition reflects a differential distribution of Mu B protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2965985)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 2.11), "[Typing of intimin (eae) genes from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) isolated from children with diarrhoea in Montevideo, Uruguay: identification of two novel intimin variants (muB and xiR/beta2B).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16914645)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 1.99), "[MuB protein allosterically activates strand transfer by the transposase of phage Mu.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1646076)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 1.62), "[Stimulation of the Mu A protein-mediated strand cleavage reaction by the Mu B protein, and the requirement of DNA nicking for stable type 1 transpososome formation. In vitro transposition characteristics of mini-Mu plasmids carrying terminal base pair mutations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1847140)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 1.07), and "[The sequence and phylogenetic analysis of avian reovirus genome segments M1, M2, and M3 encoding the minor core protein muA, the major outer capsid protein muB, and the nonstructural protein muNS.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16337282)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 1.03). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 3 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 3 experiments, and [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774) with 3 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.332 (54.23rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -1.24 (45.8th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.005 (62.55th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 30.8% (38.63rd percentile), 35.0% (59.48th percentile), and 32.5% (79.24th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 56.2 (75.06th percentile), suggesting potential instability. The isoelectric point is 6.27 (37.38th percentile), with a molecular weight of 13156.9 Da (4.51st percentile). The sequence length is 117 amino acids (4.34th percentile).
