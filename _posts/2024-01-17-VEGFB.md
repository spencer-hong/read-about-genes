[VEGFB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000173511-VEGFB) is a growth factor with heparin-binding and mitogenic properties. It is involved in cancer-related processes and is an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. VEGFB is detected in all tissues and is particularly expressed in heart muscle, contributing to heart development. In the brain, it is associated with astrocytes, while in blood, it is found in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, specifically in plasma membrane proteins. Additionally, VEGFB is part of various expression clusters, including those related to non-specific DNA binding in single cells and unknown function in cell lines.
