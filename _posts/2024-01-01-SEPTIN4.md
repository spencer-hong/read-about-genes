The gene length is 489.0 base pairs (0.43 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 489.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 489.0 base pairs.


SEPTIN4, with NCBI Gene ID 5414, has been the subject of [218 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SEPTIN4%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication dating back to 1884. The middle 50% of these publications were published between 2003 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning SEPTIN4, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[BioMart and Bioconductor: a powerful link between biological databases and microarray data analysis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16082012)" (2005) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 22.05, "[The prism model: advancing a theory of practice for arts and humanities in medical education.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33914287)" (2021) with an RCR of 6.37, "[Arts on prescription for community-dwelling older people with a range of health and wellness needs.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30345578)" (2019) with an RCR of 4.65, "[Açaí (Euterpe Oleraceae Mart.) Seeds Regulate NF-κB and Nrf2/ARE Pathways Protecting Lung against Acute and Chronic Inflammation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35551733)" (2022) with an RCR of 4.34, and "[Adoptive transfer of MART-1 T-cell receptor transgenic lymphocytes and dendritic cell vaccination in patients with metastatic melanoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24634374)" (2014) with an RCR of 4.29. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [NFYA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4800), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.786 (12.4% percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -9.42 (23.36% percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.01 (81.33% percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix and sheet structures, with affinities of 0.295 (27.5% percentile) and 0.318 (38.4% percentile), respectively. The instability index is 48.0 (50.2% percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.77 (24.57% percentile). The protein is 478 amino acids long (55.62% percentile) with a molecular weight of 55097.52 Da (57.46% percentile).
