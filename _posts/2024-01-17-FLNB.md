[FLNB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000136068-FLNB) is an actin-binding, developmental protein with evidence at the protein level. It is involved in dwarfism and is detected in all tissues. The protein is localized in the Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, actin filaments, and cytosol. FLNB is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood (non-specific - cell proliferation), Cluster 45 for tissue (intestine - digestion), Cluster 6 for brain (non-specific - immune response), Cluster 53 for cell line (squamous epithelial cells - keratinization), and Cluster 45 for single cell (non-specific - mixed function).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data highlights a diverse range of disease conditions associated with GWAS studies, including iris disease, uveal disease, various forms of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and organ system cancer, as well as respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease. Additionally, cardiovascular issues such as coronary artery disease, vascular disease, and myocardial infarction are noted. Mental health disorders, including bipolar disorder, mood disorder, and substance-related disorders, are also represented. Furthermore, the data includes immune system diseases, hematopoietic system diseases, and specific developmental disorders.


The FLNB gene has been associated with [COVID-19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34115965), which maps to the closest MeSH term [COVID-19](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000086382) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, FLNB has been linked to [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31217584).


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including BDCA4+ dendritic cells, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, prostate, placenta, and thymus. Additionally, it is expressed in nerve tissue.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways related to immune response, including the antiviral mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes, ISG15 antiviral mechanism, cytokine signaling in the immune system, interferon signaling, and the broader immune system.


The mouse ortholog gene 286940 and its human ortholog gene 2317 are associated with phenotypes such as decreased lean body mass and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, affecting both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.293 (58.89th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of -59.45 at pH 7.0 (1.69th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.007 (70.24th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 26.75% helix (10.6th percentile), 34.44% sheet (55.09th percentile), and 34.55% turn (87.94th percentile). The instability index is 35.54 (11.23rd percentile), with an isoelectric point of 5.47 (17.59th percentile). The sequence length is 2602 amino acids (98.8th percentile), resulting in a molecular weight of 278160.66 Da (98.67th percentile).
