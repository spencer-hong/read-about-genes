The gene length is 630 base pairs (0.72 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 372 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 630 base pairs.


CD19 (gene NCBI ID: 930) has been the subject of [466 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CD19%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count), with the earliest publication in 1975. The middle 50% of publications occurred between 2015 and 2021.


The top five publications mentioning CD19, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Use of CAR-Transduced Natural Killer Cells in CD19-Positive Lymphoid Tumors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32023374)" (2020) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 68.13, "[Long-Term Follow-up of CD19 CAR Therapy in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29385376)" (2018) with an RCR of 67.53, "[CD19-targeted T cells rapidly induce molecular remissions in adults with chemotherapy-refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23515080)" (2013) with an RCR of 42.27, "[CD22-targeted CAR T cells induce remission in B-ALL that is naive or resistant to CD19-targeted CAR immunotherapy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29155426)" (2018) with an RCR of 35.44, and "[Determinants of response and resistance to CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29713085)" (2018) with an RCR of 35.42. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [None](https://www.proteinatlas.org/None-None) is an FDA approved drug target with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in some tissues and is particularly expressed in B-cells, playing a role in immunoglobulin function and immune response. The gene is also associated with leukemia and signal transduction in cell lines. Notably, it is unprognostic for Breast Invasive Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma, and Testicular Germ Cell Tumor.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TAF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 12478 and its human ortholog gene 930 are associated with the phenotype of increased monocyte cell number, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.576 (27.48th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -23.67 (8.86th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.01 (81.74th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 29.50% (27.47th percentile), 30.22% (29.48th percentile), and 39.03% (96.53rd percentile), respectively. The instability index is 59.09 (81.36th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 4.87 (5.54th percentile). The sequence length is 556 amino acids (64.65th percentile), and the molecular weight is 61127.78 Da (63.83rd percentile).
