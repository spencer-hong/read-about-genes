The gene length is 1,369,273.0 base pairs (99.87% of all genes), the mature length is 3,615.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 1,369,273.0 base pairs (99.98% of all genes).


ZNF18, with NCBI Gene ID 7566, has been the subject of [2 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ZNF18%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2005, with the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2005 and 2005.


The top publications mentioning ZNF18 include "[Identification and characterization of human ZNF18 gene in silico.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15702252)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.06) and "[Molecular cloning and expression analysis of a novel human gene ZNF18.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16120570)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.04). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 6 experiments, [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 5 experiments, [OTX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5015) with 5 experiments, [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) with 5 experiments, and [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1051) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The ZNF18 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Educational attainment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35361970), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Educational Status](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004522) via a synonym direct match. Additionally, ZNF18 is associated with [Procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 2 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354), which corresponds to the MeSH term [Metalloproteases](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D045726) through an embedding match using [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.751 (14.28th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -17.602 (12.97th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.010 (80.82nd percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (33.70%, 65.42nd percentile), with lower affinities for sheet (28.42%, 20.24th percentile) and turn (27.69%, 44.46th percentile) structures. The instability index is 50.67 (59.56th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.65 (21.73rd percentile). The protein is 549 amino acids long (63.98th percentile) with a molecular weight of 62287.33 Da (64.95th percentile).
