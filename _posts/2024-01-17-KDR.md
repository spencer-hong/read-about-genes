[KDR](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000128052-KDR) is a developmental protein with kinase, receptor, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase molecular functions. It is implicated in cancer-related genes and is an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence for KDR is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many RNA tissue distributions and is localized in various subcellular locations, including the nuclear membrane, vesicles, cytosol, connecting piece, mid piece, and principal piece. KDR is expressed in tissue cluster 7, associated with adipose tissue of mixed function, brain expression cluster 42, linked to choroid plexus mitochondria, cell line expression cluster 5, related to rhabdoid cells of unknown function, and single cell expression cluster 54, involved in lymphatic endothelial cells and lymph vessel development.
