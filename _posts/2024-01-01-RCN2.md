The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 6 experiments, [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 5 experiments, [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) with 5 experiments, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) with 5 experiments, and [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.809 (11.27th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -48.60 (2.57th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.011 (83.38th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (38.80%, 90.96th percentile), with moderate affinities for sheet (32.18%, 40.56th percentile) and turn (28.39%, 50.88th percentile) structures. The instability index is 48.90 (53.47th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 4.26 (0.62nd percentile). The protein is 317 amino acids long (32.33rd percentile) with a molecular weight of 36876 Da (34.87th percentile).
