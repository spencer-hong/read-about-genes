[TP53](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141510-TP53) is a multifunctional gene with roles as an activator, DNA-binding protein, and repressor. It is implicated in various diseases, including cancer-related genes, disease variants, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and functions as a tumor suppressor. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. TP53 is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, vesicles, and cytosol. Its expression is associated with Cluster 13 in blood, Cluster 36 in lymphoid tissue, Cluster 44 in the brain, Cluster 42 in cell lines, and Cluster 16 in single cells, specifically intestinal goblet cells involved in mucin production.

The input data highlights various pathways involved in cellular senescence, stress responses, and cell cycle regulation. Key pathways include DNA damage/telomere stress-induced senescence, formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), and oxidative stress-induced senescence. Additionally, the data covers signaling pathways such as NOTCH signaling and its pre-expression and processing, as well as oncogene-induced senescence. Cell cycle regulation is represented through pathways like G1/S DNA damage checkpoints, p53-dependent G1 DNA damage response, and general cell cycle checkpoints. Apoptosis and programmed cell death pathways are also included, along with hemostasis and signal transduction processes. Specific mechanisms such as the activation of BH3-only proteins, NOXA, and PUMA, as well as the transcriptional activation of p21 and p53 responsive genes, are noted.


The mouse ortholog gene 22059, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 7157, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities.

All these phenotypes are observed in both sexes.
