The gene length is 11,227 base pairs (28.17% of all genes), the mature length is 1,334.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 9,452.5 base pairs.


The gene GUK1, with NCBI ID 2987, has been featured in [45 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GUK1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1971 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1980 and 2011. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning GUK1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Phosphorylation of acyclovir (acycloguanosine) monophosphate by GMP kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6248551)" (1980) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 7.49, "[Kinematic Evaluation of the GMK Sphere Implant During Gait Activities: A Dynamic Videofluoroscopy Study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31304995)" (2019) with an RCR of 6.64, "[Interaction of the tumor suppressor PTEN/MMAC with a PDZ domain of MAGI3, a novel membrane-associated guanylate kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10748157)" (2000) with an RCR of 3.79, "[Genome-Scale Metabolic Model of Infection with SARS-CoV-2 Mutants Confirms Guanylate Kinase as Robust Potential Antiviral Target.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34073716)" (2021) with an RCR of 1.75, and "[FBA reveals guanylate kinase as a potential target for antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV-2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33381848)" (2020) with an RCR of 1.7. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028) with 7 experiments, followed by [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), and [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126), each with 6 experiments.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [6829](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) and [9968](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968), each shown to be regulating genes in three experiments.





The mouse ortholog gene 14923 and its human ortholog gene 2987 are associated with phenotypes including decreased leukocyte cell number and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.387 (47.69th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -2.12 (42.75th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.004 (60.15th percentile). The protein has a predicted secondary structure with 33.0% helix (59.3rd percentile), 32.5% sheet (42.42nd percentile), and 28.4% turn (51.21st percentile) affinities. The instability index is 41.48 (26.86th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.11 (33.56th percentile). The protein is 197 amino acids long (14.02nd percentile) with a molecular weight of 21725.33 Da (13.75th percentile).
