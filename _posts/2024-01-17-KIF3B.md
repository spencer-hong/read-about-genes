[KIF3B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000101350-KIF3B) is a motor protein with evidence at the protein level. It is involved in diseases such as ciliopathy, disease variant, and retinitis pigmentosa. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in various subcellular locations including the nucleoplasm, primary cilium tip, cytosol, connecting piece, and flagellar centriole. KIF3B is part of expression clusters related to brain neuronal signaling, astrocyte-neuron interactions, and cilium assembly.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046), and [MYOD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4654) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the amygdala, fetal brain, cingulate cortex, globus pallidus, and olfactory bulb, as well as in the pituitary and kidney.


The proteins are involved in various pathways, including the assembly of the primary cilium, organelle biogenesis and maintenance, adaptive immune system, immune system, factors involved in megakaryocyte development and platelet production, kinesins, MHC class II antigen presentation, intraflagellar transport, hemostasis, membrane trafficking, and translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane.


The mouse ortholog gene 16569, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 9371, is associated with several phenotypes. These include increased grip strength and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, both observed in both sexes. Additionally, the gene is linked to prenatal lethality prior to heart atrial septation, although this phenotype is not observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.8732 (8.42nd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 1.076 at pH 7 (54.26th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.016 (92.88th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 38.69% helix (90.67th percentile), 28.92% sheet (22.79th percentile), and 25.70% turn (26.77th percentile). With an instability index of 54.57 (70.94th percentile), an isoelectric point of 7.30 (53.06th percentile), a length of 747 amino acids (78.08th percentile), and a molecular weight of 85124.15 Da (78.84th percentile), this protein demonstrates distinct biochemical properties.
