The gene length is 494.0 base pairs (0.45 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 494.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 494.0 base pairs.


SEPTIN5, with NCBI Gene ID 5413, has been the subject of [37 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SEPTIN5%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1974 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2000 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning SEPTIN5, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include: [Parkin functions as an E2-dependent ubiquitin- protein ligase and promotes the degradation of the synaptic vesicle-associated protein, CDCrel-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11078524) (2000) (RCR: 13.88), [t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) In acute myeloid leukemia of infant twins fuses MLL with hCDCrel, a cell division cycle gene in the genomic region of deletion in DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9600980) (1998) (RCR: 2.48), [Dopamine-dependent neurodegeneration in rats induced by viral vector-mediated overexpression of the parkin target protein, CDCrel-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14530399) (2003) (RCR: 1.8), [Protection of chickens from lethal avian influenza A virus infection by live-virus vaccination with infectious laryngotracheitis virus recombinants expressing the hemagglutinin (H5) gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11457552) (2001) (RCR: 1.52), and [Autoimmune septin-5 cerebellar ataxia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29998156) (2018) (RCR: 1.3). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 6 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 5 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 5 experiments, and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 18951 and its human ortholog gene 5413 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities, including decreased bone mineral density, preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance, short tibia, and small spleen. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.596 (25.77th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -4.46 (35.07th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.005 (64.67th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix and sheet structures, with affinities of 0.322 (52.66th percentile) and 0.341 (53.08th percentile), respectively, and a turn affinity of 0.247 (19.19th percentile). The instability index is 43.60 (34.3rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.21 (35.86th percentile). The protein is 369 amino acids long (40.95th percentile) with a molecular weight of 42776.51 Da (43.15th percentile).
