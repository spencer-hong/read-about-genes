[SCN10A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000185313-SCN10A) is a gene encoding a protein with molecular functions as an ion channel, specifically a voltage-gated sodium channel. It has been implicated in disease variants and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. The subcellular location of SCN10A includes the connecting piece and flagellar centriole. Notably, its RNA tissue distribution is not detected. In terms of expression clusters, SCN10A is found in Cluster 51 of myeloma cells, which are associated with immunoglobulins, and in Cluster 21 of early spermatids, which are involved in spermatogenesis.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SP5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/389058) with 2 experiments, followed by [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), and [LMNB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4001), each with 1 experiment.
