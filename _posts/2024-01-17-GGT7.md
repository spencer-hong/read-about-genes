The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is active in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). It is involved in the [glutathione biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006750) and the [glutathione catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006751). Additionally, it enables [glutathione hydrolase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0036374) and [leukotriene C4 gamma-glutamyl transferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0103068). The gene is also involved in the [leukotriene D4 biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1901750) and the [negative regulation of response to oxidative stress](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902883).


The gene length is 87,105 base pairs (79.21% of all genes), the mature length is 6,312 base pairs (95.02% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 87,105 base pairs (86.25% of all genes).


The gene GGT7 (NCBI ID: 2686) has been mentioned in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GGT7%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2015, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2019 and 2022.


The top publications mentioning GGT7 include "[Gamma-glutamyltransferase 7 suppresses gastric cancer by cooperating with RAB7 to induce mitophagy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35662282)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 0.53), "[Î³-Glutamyl transferase 7 is a novel regulator of glioblastoma growth.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25884624)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 0.42), and "[A genome-wide association study identifies novel association between genetic variants in GGT7 and LINC00944 and hypertension.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34047475)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.27). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GGT7](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000131067-GGT7) is a gene with molecular functions including acyltransferase, hydrolase, and transferase activities. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues, with subcellular localization in the nucleoplasm and vesicles. It is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 43 for blood expression related to transcription and translation, Cluster 79 for tissue expression related to transcription, Cluster 52 for brain expression related to synaptic function, Cluster 62 for cell line expression related to plasma proteins, and Cluster 75 for single cell expression related to salivary secretion.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), [PCBP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5093), and [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) were each found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, disease of metabolism, acquired metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism disease, glucose metabolism disease, diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypersensitivity reaction disease, blood coagulation disease, inherited blood coagulation disease, and protein C deficiency.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, brain, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Globus Pallidus and Ovary.


The input data highlights various pathways and disorders related to metabolism and detoxification. These include aflatoxin activation and detoxification, biological oxidations, and phase II conjugation processes such as glutathione conjugation and glutathione synthesis and recycling. Several genetic defects are noted, including those in ACY1, AHCY, UGT1A1, UGT1A4, GCLC, GGT1, GSS, MAT1A, OPLAH, SLC35D1, and TPMT, which are linked to conditions like encephalopathy, hypermethioninemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hemolytic anemia, glutathionuria, glutathione synthetase deficiency, methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, 5-oxoprolinase deficiency, Schneckenbecken dysplasia, and thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency. Additionally, the data covers metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes and general metabolism-related diseases.
