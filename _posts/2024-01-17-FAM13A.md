The gene enables [GTPase activator activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005096) and is located in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829). It is involved in [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165) and plays a role in the [regulation of small GTPase mediated signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051056).


The gene length is 49,764 base pairs (66.16% of all genes), the mature length is 3,756 base pairs (81.47% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 36,596 base pairs (67.87% of all genes).


The gene FAM13A (NCBI ID: 10144) has been mentioned in [36 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FAM13A%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2004 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2015 and 2020. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning FAM13A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Variants in FAM13A are associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20173748)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 7.18), "[microRNA-328 in exosomes derived from M2 macrophages exerts a promotive effect on the progression of pulmonary fibrosis via FAM13A in a rat model.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31164635)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 3.39), "[A Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Susceptibility Gene, FAM13A, Regulates Protein Stability of Î²-Catenin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26862784)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 3.17), "[LncRNA FAM13A-AS1 Regulates Proliferation and Apoptosis of Cervical Cancer Cells by Targeting miRNA-205-3p/DDI2 Axis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35783157)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 2.01), and "[FAM13A affects body fat distribution and adipocyte function.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32193374)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.86). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[FAM13A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000138640-FAM13A) is a gene with a molecular function in GTPase activation, supported by evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoli, cell junctions, and cytosol. The gene is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 33 for blood (non-specific - ATP binding), Cluster 55 for tissue (kidney & intestine - metabolism), Cluster 5 for brain (non-specific - mixed function), Cluster 10 for cell lines (ciliated cells - ion channel activity), and Cluster 53 for single cells (fibroblasts - ECM organization).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as breast cancer, thoracic cancer, reproductive organ cancer, lung cancer, hematologic cancer, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory system diseases like asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, and lower respiratory tract disease are also implicated. Metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity, are noted. Cardiovascular system diseases, such as coronary artery disease, artery disease, and vascular disease, are also present. Furthermore, the data includes nervous system diseases like neurodegenerative disease, cognitive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Other conditions mentioned are kidney disease, urinary system disease, and various specific types of cancer and metabolic disorders.


The gene FAM13A has been associated with several traits through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Externalizing behaviour (multivariate analysis)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34446935), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Parenting](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D016487) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, FAM13A is associated with [Waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (additive genetic model)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30778226), which was mapped to the MeSH term [Adaptation, Psychological](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000223) using the same embedding match method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, breast, and thyroid, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in pineal gland (both day and night), prefrontal cortex, thyroid, CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, placenta, and testis germ cells.


The proteins are involved in the Rho GTPase cycle, signaling by Rho GTPases, and signal transduction pathways.
