The gene enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is involved in various processes such as [gluconeogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006094), [lipid transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006869), and [sulfate transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008272). It is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739), [mitochondrial inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005743), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). Additionally, the gene enables several transmembrane transporter activities, including [sulfate transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015116), [thiosulfate transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015117), [oxaloacetate transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015131), [malate transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015140), and [succinate transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015141). It also enables [antiporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015297) and [oxoglutarate:malate antiporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015367). Furthermore, the gene is involved in the transport of various molecules, including [thiosulfate](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015709), [oxaloacetate](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015729), [alpha-ketoglutarate](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015742), [phosphate ion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035435), [succinate](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071422), and [malate](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071423).


The gene length is 38,609 base pairs (59.44% of all genes), the mature length is 552 base pairs (2.87% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 10,085 base pairs (33.49% of all genes).


The gene SLC25A11 (NCBI ID: 8402) has been mentioned in [8 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLC25A11%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2006 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning SLC25A11, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Germline Mutations in the Mitochondrial 2-Oxoglutarate/Malate Carrier *SLC25A11* Gene Confer a Predisposition to Metastatic Paragangliomas.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29431636)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 4.28), "[Loss of SLC25A11 causes suppression of NSCLC and melanoma tumor formation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686754)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 1.28), "[Porphyrin accumulation in mitochondria is mediated by 2-oxoglutarate carrier.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16920706)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 1.0), "[MISC-1/OGC links mitochondrial metabolism, apoptosis and insulin secretion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21448454)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 0.64), and "[SLC25A11 serves as a novel prognostic biomarker in liver cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32555317)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.48). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SLC25A11](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000108528-SLC25A11) is a gene with evidence at the protein level and is implicated in disease variants. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 10 for blood (non-specific - membrane trafficking), Cluster 23 for tissue (non-specific - cellular respiration), Cluster 45 for brain (non-specific - mixed function), Cluster 42 for cell line (non-specific - unknown function), and Cluster 39 for single cell (non-specific - basic cellular processes).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 7 experiments, [NELFE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7936) with 6 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 6 experiments, [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733) with 6 experiments, and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, muscle, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, liver, retina, 721_B_lymphoblasts, whole brain, and kidney.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, including gluconeogenesis and glucose metabolism. Additionally, they play roles in diseases such as myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora and glycogen storage diseases.


The mouse ortholog gene 67863 and its human ortholog gene 8402 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.
