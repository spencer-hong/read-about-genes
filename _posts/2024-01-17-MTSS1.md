[MTSS1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000170873-MTSS1) is an actin-binding protein that functions as a tumor suppressor. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the plasma membrane and cytosol. MTSS1 is associated with monocytes and innate immune response in blood, and it is involved in basic cellular processes across various tissues. In the brain, it is linked to transcription, while in single cells, it is associated with neurons and synaptic function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [KDM2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/84678), [GATAD2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54815), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), and [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and organ system cancer, as well as immune system diseases and respiratory system diseases like lung disease.
