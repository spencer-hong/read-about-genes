Furthermore, it enables [small ribosomal subunit rRNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070181) and is located in the [cytoplasmic stress granule](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010494).


The gene length is 20,031 base pairs (42.09% of all genes), the mature length is 858 base pairs (16.48% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 9,299 base pairs (31.43% of all genes).


The gene CIRBP (NCBI ID: 1153) has been mentioned in [82 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CIRBP%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning CIRBP was in 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2016 and 2021.


The top 5 publications mentioning CIRBP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Extracellular CIRP (eCIRP) and inflammation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30645013)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 6.18), "[A glycine-rich RNA-binding protein mediating cold-inducible suppression of mammalian cell growth.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9151692)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 5.48), "[Cold-inducible proteins CIRP and RBM3, a unique couple with activities far beyond the cold.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27147467)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 5.22), "[Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein modulates circadian gene expression posttranscriptionally.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22923437)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 5.08), and "[Emodin Alleviates Severe Acute Pancreatitis-Associated Acute Lung Injury by Inhibiting the Cold-Inducible RNA-Binding Protein (CIRP)-Mediated Activation of the NLRP3/IL-1<i>Î²</i>/CXCL1 Signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33967799)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 4.2). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CIRBP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000099622-CIRBP) is a multifunctional gene that acts as an activator, repressor, and RNA-binding protein. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localizes to the nucleoplasm. CIRBP is involved in nuclear processes and is associated with ribosomal functions in various tissue and cell line expression clusters. Notably, it is specifically expressed in ovarian stromal cells, where it plays a role in transcription. The gene's expression has been observed in the brain, contributing to transcription processes. Evidence supporting these functions is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 6 experiments, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 5 experiments, [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) with 5 experiments, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) with 5 experiments, and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (night), retina, thyroid, cerebellum peduncles, pancreatic islet, pituitary, and ovary.
