It is active in the [endomembrane system](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0012505) and is part of the [SNARE complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031201). Additionally, it acts upstream of or within [endocytic recycling](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032456).


The gene length is 11,196 base pairs (28.09% of all genes), the mature length is 2,313.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 10,368 base pairs (34.27% of all genes).


The gene STX6 (NCBI ID: 10228) has been mentioned in [31 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22STX6%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2001 and 2014. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning STX6, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Syntaxin 6 functions in trans-Golgi network vesicle trafficking.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9243506)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 4.38), "[The Rab5 effector EEA1 interacts directly with syntaxin-6.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10506127)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 3.05), "[Syntaxin 6-mediated exosome secretion regulates enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31674708)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 2.5), "[Cholesterol regulates Syntaxin 6 trafficking at trans-Golgi network endosomal boundaries.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24746815)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 2.46), and "[Syntaxin 6 and Vti1b form a novel SNARE complex, which is up-regulated in activated macrophages to facilitate exocytosis of tumor necrosis Factor-alpha.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15640147)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 2.06). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[STX6](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000135823-STX6) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized in the nucleoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and cytosol. STX6 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 22 in eosinophils related to transcription, Cluster 80 in non-specific tissues related to endocytosis, Cluster 34 in the brain with mixed functions, Cluster 45 in cell lines related to nuclear processes, and Cluster 58 in macrophages involved in the innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), and [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) was found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates a hierarchical classification of diseases, progressing from general to specific. It begins with a broad category of 'disease', narrowing down to 'disease of anatomical entity', and further specifying to 'nervous system disease', 'central nervous system disease', and 'brain disease'. Within brain diseases, it focuses on 'movement disease', ultimately identifying 'progressive supranuclear palsy' as the most specific condition.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including nerve tissue, pineal gland during the day, CD33+ myeloid cells, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ natural killer cells, CD14+ monocytes, whole blood, fetal brain, and bronchial epithelial cells. This indicates a ubiquitous expression pattern across multiple tissue samples.



The mouse ortholog gene 58244 and its human ortholog gene 10228 are associated with phenotypes including hyperactivity and increased blood urea nitrogen levels, with these effects observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.421 (43.71% percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -12.17 (19.13% percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.008 (75.0% percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix (34.9%, 74.06% percentile) and sheet (36.1%, 66.85% percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (23.9%, 14.56% percentile). The instability index is 47.75 (49.24% percentile), and the isoelectric point is 4.84 (5.11% percentile). The protein is 255 amino acids long (22.37% percentile) with a molecular weight of 29175.61 Da (23.34% percentile).
