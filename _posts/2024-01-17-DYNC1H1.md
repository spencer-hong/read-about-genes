[DYNC1H1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000197102-DYNC1H1) is a motor protein with evidence at the protein level. It is implicated in various diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, intellectual disability, neurodegeneration, and neuropathy. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized to the centrosome, cytosol, flagellar centriole, mid piece, and annulus. Its expression is associated with Cluster 21 in neutrophils, Cluster 79 in non-specific transcription, Cluster 37 in neurons with mixed function, Cluster 30 in non-specific gene expression regulation, and Cluster 55 in non-specific transcription at the single-cell level.

The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as breast cancer, thoracic cancer, and organ system cancer. Additionally, the data highlights infectious diseases, particularly those caused by viral agents like human immunodeficiency virus. Metabolic disorders are also prominent, with a focus on diabetes mellitus, specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus, and related conditions such as obesity and carbohydrate metabolism diseases. Cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and artery disease, are also noted. Furthermore, the data includes neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and tauopathy, as well as cognitive disorders and dementia. Lastly, musculoskeletal system diseases, particularly osteoporosis, are also associated with the GWAS findings.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, brain, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Subthalamic Nucleus, Parietal Lobe, Pons, Ciliary Ganglion, Dorsal Root Ganglion, and Globus Pallidus.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to the cell cycle, including mitotic cell cycle, centrosome maturation, and G2/M transition. They also participate in the anchoring of the basal body to the plasma membrane, the recruitment of mitotic centrosome proteins, and the loss of proteins required for interphase microtubule organization from the centrosome. Additionally, these proteins play roles in the assembly of the primary cilium, organelle biogenesis and maintenance, and the adaptive immune system, specifically in MHC class II antigen presentation.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.341 (53.25th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature.
