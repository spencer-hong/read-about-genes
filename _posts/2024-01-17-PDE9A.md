The gene length is 13,447 base pairs (32.38% of all genes), the mature length is 1,793 base pairs (46.98% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 9,745.5 base pairs (32.56% of all genes).


The gene PDE9A, with NCBI ID 5152, has been mentioned in [31 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PDE9A%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning PDE9A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Isolation and characterization of PDE9A, a novel human cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9624146)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 6.51), "[In vivo assessment of local phosphodiesterase activity using tailored cyclic nucleotide-gated channels as cAMP sensors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11429444)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 2.51), "[A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the PDE9A inhibitor, PF-04447943, in Alzheimer's disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24801218)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 2.33), "[PDE9A inhibition rescues amyloid beta-induced deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24746365)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 1.94), and "[Phosphodiesterase 9A regulates central cGMP and modulates responses to cholinergic and monoaminergic perturbation in vivo.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22328573)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 1.92). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PDE9A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000160191-PDE9A) is a hydrolase with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is localized in the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, and cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including T-cells in blood, intestinal tissues, astrocytes in the brain, prostate cancer cell lines, and enterocytes in single-cell analysis. Notably, PDE9A is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma, Ovary Serous Cystadenocarcinoma, and Rectum Adenocarcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 4 experiments, and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) with 3 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including leukocyte disease, asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, kidney disease, urinary system disease, nervous system disease, central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, synucleinopathy, Parkinson's disease, developmental disorder of mental health, specific developmental disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory system disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, eosinophilia, and auditory system disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including prostate, colon, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Cardiac Myocytes, Burkitt's Lymphoma (Raji), CD4+ T cells, Fetal Brain, Colorectal Adenocarcinoma, Prostate, and Olfactory Bulb, suggesting a ubiquitous expression pattern across multiple tissue samples.


The input data indicates that nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase, leading to cgmp effects. These processes are involved in platelet homeostasis and hemostasis.
