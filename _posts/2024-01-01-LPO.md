The gene length is 589,739 base pairs (98.86% of all genes), the mature length is 2,543.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 581,839 base pairs (99.49% of all genes).


The gene LPO has an NCBI ID of 4025. It has been featured in [243 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22LPO%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1957, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1983 and 2010.


The top 5 publications mentioning LPO, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Rosmarinic acid inhibits some metabolic enzymes including glutathione S-transferase, lactoperoxidase, acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase and carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26864149)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 8.29), "[Lactoperoxidase: physico-chemical properties, occurrence, mechanism of action and applications.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11242442)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 4.8), "[Purification and characterization of human salivary peroxidase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3349028)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 4.62), "[Lactoperoxidase activity in human milk and in saliva of newborn infants.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1140845)" (1975) (relative citation ratio: 4.49), and "[Lactoperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate: equilibria between oxidized forms of thiocyanate.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7248282)" (1981) (relative citation ratio: 4.44). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [LPO](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000135494-LPO) exhibits antimicrobial, oxidoreductase, and peroxidase molecular functions. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in the salivary gland and salivary secretion (Cluster 38). In the brain, it is involved in monoamines and neurotransmitter signalling (Cluster 41). Additionally, the gene is expressed in myeloid leukemia cell lines, contributing to the innate immune response (Cluster 14), and is particularly active in serous glandular cells involved in salivary secretion (Cluster 75). The gene's prognostic value in breast invasive carcinoma is unprognostic (8.81e-2).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 4 experiments, [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) each with 3 experiments, and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1051) each with 2 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.381 (48.39th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 12.56 at pH 7.0 (85.95th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.002 (50.35th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 30.76% helix (38.59th percentile), 34.97% sheet (58.96th percentile), and 30.62% turn (68.22nd percentile). The instability index is 40.30 (23.12th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.89 (76.15th percentile). The protein has a length of 712 amino acids (76.1st percentile) and a molecular weight of 80286.95 Da (76.4th percentile).
