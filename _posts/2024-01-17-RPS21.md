[RPS21](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000171858-RPS21) is a ribonucleoprotein and ribosomal protein with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. The gene is part of Cluster 24 for blood expression, Cluster 18 for tissue expression, Cluster 28 for brain expression, Cluster 25 for cell line expression, and Cluster 64 for single cell expression, all of which are associated with non-specific ribosomal functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) with 6 experiments, [SMARCB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6598) with 5 experiments, [AFF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4299) with 5 experiments, [TFAP2C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7022) with 5 experiments, and [GATA6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2627) with 4 experiments.
