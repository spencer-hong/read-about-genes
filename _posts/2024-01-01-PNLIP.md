The gene length is 496.0 base pairs (0.47% of all genes), with a mature length of 496.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 496.0 base pairs.


The gene PNLIP has an NCBI Gene ID of 5406. It has been featured in [162 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PNLIP%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1945, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1986 and 2015.


The top five publications mentioning PNLIP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Structure of human pancreatic lipase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2106079)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 26.69), "[Pancreatic lipase inhibitors from natural sources: unexplored potential.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17933690)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 12.53), "[Phenolic profiles of 20 Canadian lentil cultivars and their contribution to antioxidant activity and inhibitory effects on Î±-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25442631)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 11.62), "[Structure of the pancreatic lipase-procolipase complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1522902)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 8.49), and "[Antioxidant and pancreatic lipase inhibitory effects of flavonoids from different citrus peel extracts: An in vitro study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32438224)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 6.48). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [PRSS1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196486-PRSS1) functions as a hydrolase and is implicated in disease variants, with FDA-approved drug targets. Evidence supports its expression at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the pancreas, where it is involved in proteolysis. In cell lines, it is found in non-specific mitochondria clusters, and in single cells, it is expressed in pancreatic exocrine cells involved in proteolysis. The gene is unprognostic for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 2 experiments, followed by [NUP98](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4928), [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [NFKB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4790), each with 1 experiment.











The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.223, indicating a hydrophilic nature (66.9% percentile). At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -3.63 (37.61% percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.9997 (40.09% percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 23.23% helix (2.69% percentile), 36.99% sheet (72.9% percentile), and 34.84% turn (88.79% percentile). The instability index is 29.53 (3.63% percentile), with an isoelectric point of 6.27 (37.34% percentile). The protein has a length of 465 amino acids (53.78% percentile) and a molecular weight of 51156.23 Da (52.98% percentile).
