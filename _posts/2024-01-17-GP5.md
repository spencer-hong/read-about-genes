The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). It is involved in [cell adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007155), [blood coagulation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007596), and specifically the [intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007597). Additionally, it plays a role in the [positive regulation of platelet activation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010572), [megakaryocyte development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035855), and the [release of sequestered calcium ion into cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051209). The gene is also part of the [glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990779).


The gene length is 36,818 base pairs (58.26% of all genes), the mature length is 3,753 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 36,818 base pairs.


GP5 has been mentioned in [170 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GP5%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning GP5 is 1984, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2014.


The top 5 publications mentioning GP5, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include: ["A general primer GP5+/GP6(+)-mediated PCR-enzyme immunoassay method for rapid detection of 14 high-risk and 6 low-risk human papillomavirus genotypes in cervical scrapings."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9041439) (1997) (RCR: 14.02), ["GP5+/6+ PCR followed by reverse line blot analysis enables rapid and high-throughput identification of human papillomavirus genotypes."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11880393) (2002) (RCR: 11.4), ["PCR detection of human papillomavirus: comparison between MY09/MY11 and GP5+/GP6+ primer systems."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9163434) (1997) (RCR: 10.87), ["Discovery of a small arterivirus gene that overlaps the GP5 coding sequence and is important for virus production."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21307223) (2011) (RCR: 7.83), and ["Identification of neutralizing and nonneutralizing epitopes in the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus GP5 ectodomain."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11932389) (2002) (RCR: 7.62). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GP5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000178732-GP5) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, primarily detected in single RNA tissue distribution. It is localized in the cytosol and is notably expressed in lymphoid tissue, playing a role in immune response (Cluster 70). Additionally, GP5 is associated with leukemia and signal transduction in cell line expression (Cluster 6) and is specifically expressed in T-cells, contributing to T-cell receptor function (Cluster 7).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) with 3 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 2 experiments, and [SIRT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23411), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [STAT5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6777) each with 1 experiment.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, and broader respiratory system disease. Additionally, the data highlights links to general disease categories, diseases of anatomical entities, and diseases of mental health. Notably, there are specific associations with substance-related disorders, particularly substance dependence and alcohol dependence.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the fallopian tube and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), heart, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, and trigeminal ganglion.


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in hemostasis, including GP1b-IX-V activation signaling, platelet adhesion to exposed collagen, formation of fibrin clot (clotting cascade), the intrinsic pathway, and platelet aggregation (plug formation). Additionally, the data encompasses broader processes such as hemostasis and platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation.



The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.131 (88.82nd percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. At pH 7, the protein carries a charge of 15.04 (89.07th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.992 (14.1st percentile). The protein's secondary structure tends to be 36.43% helix (82.83rd percentile), 37.68% sheet (76.83rd percentile), and 30.54% turn (67.63rd percentile). The instability index is 46.48 (44.77th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 9.73 (94.13th percentile). The protein is 560 amino acids long (65.03rd percentile) with a molecular weight of 60958.45 Da (63.67th percentile).
