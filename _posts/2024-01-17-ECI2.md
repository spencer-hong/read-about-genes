The gene enables [fatty-acyl-CoA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000062) and [delta(3)-delta(2)-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004165), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739), [peroxisome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005777), [peroxisomal matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005782), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and [intracellular membrane-bounded organelle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043231). Additionally, it is involved in [fatty acid beta-oxidation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006635).


The gene length is 43,862.0 base pairs (62.84% of all genes), the mature length is 849.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 27,552.5 base pairs.


The gene ECI2 (NCBI ID: 10455) has been mentioned in [3 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ECI2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1999 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2009 and 2020. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top publications mentioning ECI2 include "[Characterization of PECI, a novel monofunctional Delta(3), Delta(2)-enoyl-CoA isomerase of mammalian peroxisomes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10419495)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 1.39), "[A comprehensive analysis of the expression, epigenetic and genetic changes of HNF1B and ECI2 in 122 cases of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33574924)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.39), and "[HNF1B, EZH2 and ECI2 in prostate carcinoma. Molecular, immunohistochemical and clinico-pathological study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32873863)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.28). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ECI2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198721-ECI2) is an isomerase with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in peroxisomes and mitochondria. The gene is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood (non-specific - cell proliferation), Cluster 53 for tissue (non-specific - glycosylation), Cluster 21 for brain (non-specific - metabolism), Cluster 72 for cell lines (neuronal - signal transduction), and Cluster 56 for single cells (proximal tubular cells - amino acid metabolism).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 6 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 5 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 5 experiments, and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including general disease, disease of anatomical entity, bone disease, connective tissue disease, musculoskeletal system disease, bone remodeling disease, and bone resorption disease.



The gene is expressed in the adrenal gland and stomach. Additionally, it is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, kidney, and fetal liver.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.277 (60.56th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 9.91 at pH 7.0 (81.25th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.005 (63.38th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 35.53% helix (78.1st percentile), 34.26% sheet (53.8th percentile), and 29.19% turn (57.5th percentile). The instability index is 43.11 (32.59th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.13 (82.55th percentile). The protein has a length of 394 amino acids (44.46th percentile) and a molecular weight of 43584.65 Da (44.09th percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, which can be found [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
