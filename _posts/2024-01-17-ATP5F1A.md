The gene has a length of 40,740 base pairs (60.82 percentile of all genes), a mature length of 1,490 base pairs, and a primary transcript length of 30,192 base pairs.


The gene ATP5F1A (NCBI ID: 498) has been mentioned in [18 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ATP5F1A%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1969, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2000 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning ATP5F1A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Orm family proteins mediate sphingolipid homeostasis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182505)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 10.47), "[C9ORF72-ALS/FTD-associated poly(GR) binds Atp5a1 and compromises mitochondrial function in vivo.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31086314)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 6.96), "[A complex V ATP5A1 defect causes fatal neonatal mitochondrial encephalopathy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23599390)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 2.1), "[Chronic stress inhibits testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells through mitochondrial damage via Atp5a1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894202)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 1.49), and "[Blockade of sodiumâ€‘calcium exchanger via ORM-10962 attenuates cardiac alternans.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33383036)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.23). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ATP5F1A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000152234-ATP5F1A) is a gene involved in primary mitochondrial disease, with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized to the mitochondria, specifically the end piece. The gene is expressed in various clusters related to mitochondria and cellular respiration, including Cluster 13 in blood, Cluster 23 in tissue, Cluster 23 in the brain (choroid plexus), Cluster 13 in cell lines, and Cluster 39 in single cells. Notably, the gene is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma and Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma.
