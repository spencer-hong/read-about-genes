The gene length is 11,486 base pairs (28.7% of all genes), the mature length is 1,097 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 11,486 base pairs.


The gene TPPP (NCBI ID: 11076) has been mentioned in [83 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TPPP%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1982 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1993 and 2014. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning TPPP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Multiple system atrophy-associated oligodendroglial protein p25α stimulates formation of novel α-synuclein strain with enhanced neurodegenerative potential.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33978813)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 6.24), "[The Golgi Outpost Protein TPPP Nucleates Microtubules and Is Critical for Myelination.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31522887)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 3.61), "[p25alpha relocalizes in oligodendroglia from myelin to cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17823288)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 3.19), "[p25alpha Stimulates alpha-synuclein aggregation and is co-localized with aggregated alpha-synuclein in alpha-synucleinopathies.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590652)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 3.14), and "[Endogenous oligodendroglial alpha-synuclein and TPPP/p25α orchestrate alpha-synuclein pathology in experimental multiple system atrophy models.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31011860)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 2.76). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TPPP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000171368-TPPP) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the mitochondria and cytosol. It is notably expressed in Cluster 33, associated with brain neuronal signaling, and in Cluster 34, which has non-specific mixed functions in the brain. Additionally, TPPP is expressed in Cluster 9, related to skin cancer and melanin biosynthesis in cell lines, and in Cluster 51, associated with oligodendrocytes of unknown function in single-cell expression.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), and [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341) and [NR2F2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7026) were found to be regulating in 3 experiments each.



The input data indicates a hierarchical classification of disease conditions, starting from a general 'disease' category and narrowing down to specific conditions. This includes 'disease of anatomical entity', 'nervous system disease', 'sensory system disease', 'auditory system disease', 'middle ear disease', and ultimately 'otitis media'.



The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, pons, and globus pallidus. Additionally, it is expressed in the pituitary gland.



The mouse ortholog gene 72948, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 11076, has been associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal behavior and decreased thigmotaxis, which are observed in both sexes. Additionally, the gene is linked to abnormal sleep behavior and convulsive seizures, although these phenotypes are not observed in both sexes. Furthermore, the gene is associated with hyperactivity and increased circulating chloride levels, which are present in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.755 (14.04th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 9.94 at pH 7.0 (81.33rd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.015 (91.15th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 35.62% helix (78.59th percentile), 26.03% sheet (11.37th percentile), and 30.14% turn (64.79th percentile). The instability index is 32.46 (6.34th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.48 (90.66th percentile). The protein has a length of 219 amino acids (17.33rd percentile) and a molecular weight of 23693.43 Da (16.29th percentile).
