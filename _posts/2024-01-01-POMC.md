The gene length is 387 base pairs (0.25 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 387 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 387 base pairs.


The gene POMC, with NCBI ID 5443, has been featured in [12,381 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POMC%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1946, and the middle 50% of publications span from 1956 to 1995.


The top five publications mentioning POMC, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Characterization of a 41-residue ovine hypothalamic peptide that stimulates secretion of corticotropin and beta-endorphin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6267699)" (1981) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 135.88, "[Leptin activates anorexigenic POMC neurons through a neural network in the arcuate nucleus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11373681)" (2001) with an RCR of 37.15, "[Corticosteroid inhibition of ACTH secretion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6323158)" (1984) with an RCR of 36.07, "[Foot-shock induced stress increases beta-endorphin levels in blood but not brain.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/201864)" (1977) with an RCR of 26.44, and "[Severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation caused by POMC mutations in humans.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9620771)" (1998) with an RCR of 26.08. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [POMC](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000133703-POMC) functions as an endorphin and hormone, with evidence at the protein level. It is implicated in cancer-related genes and obesity. The gene is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in the pituitary gland, involved in hormone signaling, and the hypothalamus, associated with neuropeptide signaling. It is also found in ciliated cells with ion channel activity and late spermatids involved in spermatogenesis. The gene is part of the non-specific mitochondria blood expression cluster.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 3 experiments, [EBF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1879) with 3 experiments, [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) with 3 experiments, and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 18976 and its human ortholog gene 5443 are associated with several phenotypes, including abnormal spleen morphology, enlarged spleen, and preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.9134831460674152 (6.87th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 0.8468597302869938 (53.32nd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.0194285714285714 (96.46th percentile). The protein has a high instability index of 50.89999999999999 (60.12th percentile) and an isoelectric point of 7.565235710144044 (54.72nd percentile). The sequence length is 267 amino acids (24.02nd percentile) with a molecular weight of 29423.652699999973 Da (23.69th percentile).
