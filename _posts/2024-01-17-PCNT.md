The gene is involved in [microtubule cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000226) and [mitotic spindle organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007052), playing a role in [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165) and [positive regulation of intracellular protein transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0090316). It enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [calmodulin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005516), and [molecular adaptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060090), acting upstream of or within [cilium assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060271). The gene is located in the [centrosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005813), [centriole](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005814), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [microtubule](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005874), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and [centriolar satellite](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0034451).


The gene length is 19,992 base pairs (42.07% of all genes), the mature length is 2,528.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 16,194 base pairs.


The gene PCNT (NCBI ID: 5116) has been mentioned in [231 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PCNT%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning PCNT is 1949, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2017.


The top five publications mentioning PCNT, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mutations in pericentrin cause Seckel syndrome with defective ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18157127)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 4.43), "[The PACT domain, a conserved centrosomal targeting motif in the coiled-coil proteins AKAP450 and pericentrin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11263498)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 4.04), "[PLK1 phosphorylation of pericentrin initiates centrosome maturation at the onset of mitosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22184200)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 3.99), "[Centrosomal proteins CG-NAP and kendrin provide microtubule nucleation sites by anchoring gamma-tubulin ring complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12221128)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 2.99), and "[Pericentrin in cellular function and disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19951897)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 2.85). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PCNT](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000160299-PCNT) is a gene with a molecular function in calmodulin-binding and is implicated in dwarfism. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in skeletal muscle, where it is involved in striated muscle contraction. Subcellularly, PCNT is localized to the centriolar satellite, centrosome, cytosol, flagellar centriole, and mid piece. In the brain, it is expressed in the cerebral cortex, and in blood, it is found in basophils, although its function in these cells is unknown. Additionally, PCNT is expressed in leukemia cell lines and skeletal myocytes, where it plays a role in muscle contraction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [INTS11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54973), [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667), and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including several types of cancer such as lung cancer and organ system cancer, as well as diseases affecting different organ systems. Notably, respiratory system cancer, kidney disease, urinary system disease, and nervous system disease are highlighted. Additionally, the data includes mental health conditions such as cognitive disorder, psychotic disorder, and schizophrenia. Musculoskeletal system diseases, including bone disease and connective tissue disease, are also represented. Furthermore, the data encompasses eye and adnexa diseases, specifically corneal disease.


The genome-wide association study identified a significant association between PCNT and [pre-treatment viral load in HIV-1 infection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31219150), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [HIV-1](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015497) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including heart, muscle, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, skeletal muscle, and leukemia lymphoblastic cells (MOLT-4).


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to the cell cycle, including mitotic cell cycle, centrosome maturation, and G2/M transition. Additionally, they participate in the anchoring of the basal body to the plasma membrane, recruitment of mitotic centrosome proteins and complexes, and the regulation of PLK1 activity at the G2/M transition. These proteins also play roles in the assembly of the primary cilium and organelle biogenesis and maintenance.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.817 (10.89th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature.
