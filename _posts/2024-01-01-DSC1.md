The gene length is 621,800 base pairs (98.93% of all genes), the mature length is 1,552.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 586,993 base pairs.


The gene DSC1 (NCBI ID: 1823) has been the subject of [22 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DSC1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1993 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2004 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning DSC1, ranked by their relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows. The most influential publication is "[CircRAB11FIP1 promoted autophagy flux of ovarian cancer through DSC1 and miR-129.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33637694)" (2021) with a relative citation ratio of 4.74. Another notable study is "[Expression of keratin 1, keratin 10, desmoglein 1 and desmocollin 1 in the epidermis: possible downregulation by interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 in atopic dermatitis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28524044)" (2017) with a relative citation ratio of 1.56. Additionally, "[Subcorneal pustular dermatosis type of IgA pemphigus: demonstration of autoantibodies to desmocollin-1 and clinical review.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10886149)" (2000) has a relative citation ratio of 1.54. The publication "[Coordinated expression of desmoglein 1 and desmocollin 1 regulates intercellular adhesion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15606501)" (2004) has a relative citation ratio of 1.51. Lastly, "[Cloning of the cDNA (DSC1) coding for human type 1 desmocollin and its assignment to chromosome 18.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8288219)" (1993) has a relative citation ratio of 1.05.
