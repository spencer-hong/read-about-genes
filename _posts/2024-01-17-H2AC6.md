The gene is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), and is also found in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). It is part of the [nucleosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000786) and enables molecular functions such as [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [structural constituent of chromatin](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030527), [nucleosomal DNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031492), and [protein heterodimerization activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046982). The gene is involved in the [negative regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008285) and [heterochromatin organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070828).


The gene length is 12,018 base pairs (29.69% of all genes), the mature length is 1,600 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 12,018 base pairs.


The gene H2AC6, with NCBI ID 8334, has been mentioned in [1 publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22H2AC6%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 2010, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2010 to 2010.


The top publication mentioning H2AC6 is "[Histone H2A C-terminus regulates chromatin dynamics, remodeling, and histone H1 binding.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21170357)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 1.24). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[H2AC6](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000180573-H2AC6) is a DNA-binding protein involved in cancer-related genes, with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in the nucleoplasm. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 35 in neutrophils for blood expression, Cluster 34 for non-specific mixed function in tissue expression, Cluster 55 for non-specific transcription in brain expression, Cluster 41 for non-specific nucleosome assembly in cell line expression, and Cluster 57 for platelets in single cell expression.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) and [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1051), each with 5 experiments, followed by [SUMO2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6613), also with 5 experiments. Additionally, [RCOR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23186) and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.




The genome-wide association study has identified a link between H2AC6 and [Monocyte percentage of white cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), which has been mapped to the closest MeSH term [Monocytes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D009000) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including prostate and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in pineal gland (both day and night), whole blood, chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), prostate, bone marrow, and thymus.


The input data highlights a diverse array of biological processes and pathways, including gene expression, mitotic prophase, and regulatory RNA pathways. Key processes involve transcriptional regulation by small RNAs, DNA damage/telomere stress-induced senescence, and the formation of amyloids. Chromosomal dynamics are emphasized through pathways such as condensation of prophase chromosomes, DNA methylation, and packaging of telomere ends. Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone and DNA methylation by PRC2, and nucleosome assembly, are also prominent. Cellular senescence and responses to stress, particularly oxidative stress-induced senescence, are noted. Additionally, the data covers meiosis, meiotic synapsis, and recombination, as well as chromosome and telomere maintenance. Wnt signaling pathways, including those involved in cancer, and cell cycle processes, particularly the mitotic phase, are also included.



The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.458 (39.41 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 16.85 at pH 7.0 (90.92 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.003 (56.26 percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be predominantly helical, with 41.54% of residues in helix form (95.53 percentile), 29.23% in sheet form (24.39 percentile), and 24.62% in turn form (18.8 percentile). The instability index is 50.66 (59.5 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 11.05 (99.09 percentile). The protein has a length of 130 amino acids (5.82 percentile) and a molecular weight of 14105.29 Da (5.39 percentile).
