The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [morphogenesis of an epithelium](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002009), [cell adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007155), and [cell-matrix adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007160). It enables molecular functions such as [dystroglycan binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002162), [actin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003779), [structural molecule activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005198), and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). The gene is located in multiple cellular components, including the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005856), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), [cell-cell junction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005911), [adherens junction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005912), [fascia adherens](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005916), and [focal adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005925). Additionally, the gene is active in the [cell-cell contact zone](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0044291) and is part of a [protein-containing complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032991).


The gene length is 27,112.0 base pairs (49.9% of all genes), the mature length is 591.0 base pairs (5.09% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 20,692.0 base pairs (52.51% of all genes).


The gene VCL (NCBI ID: 7414) has been mentioned in [407 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22VCL%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1976, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1994 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning VCL, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Stretching single talin rod molecules activates vinculin binding.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19179532)" (2009) with a relative citation ratio of 22.43, "[Vinculin controls focal adhesion formation by direct interactions with talin and actin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18056416)" (2007) with a relative citation ratio of 13.46, "[Paxillin: a new vinculin-binding protein present in focal adhesions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2118142)" (1990) with a relative citation ratio of 12.27, "[Vinculin in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28401269)" (2017) with a relative citation ratio of 10.53, and "[Vinculin potentiates E-cadherin mechanosensing and is recruited to actin-anchored sites within adherens junctions in a myosin II-dependent manner.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20584916)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 10.04. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[VCL](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000035403-VCL) is an actin-binding protein with evidence at the protein level, implicated in cardiomyopathy and disease variants. It is detected in all tissues and localizes to focal adhesion sites. VCL is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, associated with degranulation, and is found in smooth muscle tissue, involved in extracellular matrix organization. In the brain, it is expressed in the choroid plexus, associated with mitochondria. Additionally, VCL is expressed in smooth muscle cells, playing a role in muscle contraction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 6 experiments, [KLF4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9314) with 5 experiments, [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) with 4 experiments, [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942) with 4 experiments, and [HIF1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3091) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent detection in CHIP-seq studies.


The transcription factor [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623) was found to be regulating genes in one Perturb-seq experiment, according to data from GTRD's database of transcription factor binding sites and the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).


The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and cardiovascular system disease. Additionally, there are links to various nervous system diseases, such as central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, cognitive disorder, and disease of mental health. Furthermore, the data highlights associations with female reproductive system disease, reproductive system disease, ovarian disease, and premature ovarian failure.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood vessel, uterus, and bladder, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, adipocytes, colon, appendix, uterus corpus, uterus, and testis germ cells.


The proteins are involved in various pathways, including muscle contraction, smooth muscle contraction, hemostasis, platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, platelet degranulation, and the response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca2+.
