[MTMR2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000087053-MTMR2) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function. It is implicated in several diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, neurodegeneration, and neuropathy, with evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in vesicles. In the brain, MTMR2 is expressed in oligodendrocytes and is part of a mixed function cluster. Additionally, it is expressed in various cell lines and single cells, particularly in oligodendrocytes, although its function in these contexts is not well understood.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), and [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.

The gene is expressed in various tissues, including nerve and blood vessel, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, testis Leydig cells, and testis germ cells.


The input data highlights various pathways involved in metabolism, specifically focusing on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Within this context, phospholipid metabolism is emphasized, particularly the PI metabolism pathway. This includes the synthesis of PIPs at both the early and late endosome membranes.
