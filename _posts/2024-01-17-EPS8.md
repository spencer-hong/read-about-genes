The gene enables [actin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003779) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is involved in various processes such as [Rho protein signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007266), [adult locomotory behavior](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008344), and [regulation of cell shape](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008360). It is located in multiple cellular components, including the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), [brush border](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005903), [cell cortex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005938), [postsynaptic density](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0014069), [growth cone](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030426), [vesicle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031982), [stereocilium](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032420), [stereocilium tip](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032426), [ruffle membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032587), and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). Additionally, it is part of the [NMDA selective glutamate receptor complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0017146) and is active in the [ruffle membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032587). The gene also plays roles in processes like [exit from mitosis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010458), [Rac protein signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016601), [regulation of actin filament length](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030832), [regulation of Rho protein signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035023), [dendritic cell migration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0036336), [behavioral response to ethanol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048149), [barbed-end actin filament capping](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051016), [actin filament bundle assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051017), [actin crosslink formation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051764), [actin polymerization-dependent cell motility](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070358), [regulation of postsynaptic membrane neurotransmitter receptor levels](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0099072), [positive regulation of ruffle assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1900029), and [cellular response to leukemia inhibitory factor](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990830).


The gene length is 721.0 base pairs (0.89 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 528.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 721.0 base pairs.


EPS8 (Gene ID: 2059) has been mentioned in [90 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22EPS8%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning EPS8 was in 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2018.


The top five publications mentioning EPS8, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[EPS8 and E3B1 transduce signals from Ras to Rac.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10499589)" (1999) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 4.48, "[The Eps8 protein coordinates EGF receptor signalling through Rac and trafficking through Rab5.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11099046)" (2000) with an RCR of 3.53, "[Regulation of cell shape by Cdc42 is mediated by the synergic actin-bundling activity of the Eps8-IRSp53 complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17115031)" (2006) with an RCR of 3.43, "[Eps8, a substrate for the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, enhances EGF-dependent mitogenic signals.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8404850)" (1993) with an RCR of 2.95, and "[Eps8 controls actin-based motility by capping the barbed ends of actin filaments.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15558031)" (2004) with an RCR of 2.68. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[EPS8](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000151491-EPS8) is an actin-binding protein with evidence at the protein level. It is involved in deafness and non-syndromic deafness. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in the plasma membrane. It is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, playing a role in the innate immune response. EPS8 is also involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) organization in connective tissue and has mixed functions in the hindbrain. Additionally, it is expressed in connective tissue cells and smooth muscle cells, where it participates in signal transduction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various metabolic disorders, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, glucose metabolism diseases, diabetes mellitus, and specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including cardiac myocytes, fetal brain, adipocytes, pancreas, colon, small intestine, and uterus. Additionally, it is expressed in adipose tissue.
