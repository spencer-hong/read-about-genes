The gene enables [protein phosphatase inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004864) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is located in the [nucleolus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005730).


The gene length is 52,642 base pairs (67.79% of all genes), the mature length is 3,017 base pairs (72.75% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 52,639 base pairs (76.51% of all genes).


PPP1R26 has been mentioned in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PPP1R26%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2005, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2008 to 2022.


The gene PPP1R26 has been the subject of several influential publications. The top-cited works include "[PPP1R26 drives hepatocellular carcinoma progression by controlling glycolysis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35292107)" (2022) with a relative citation ratio of 3.03, and "[Clinical Potential of lncRNA PPP1R26-AS1 in Breast Cancer and Its Contribution to Cancer Progression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35064892)" (2022) with a relative citation ratio of 0.35. Additionally, "[KIAA0649, a 1A6/DRIM-interacting protein with the oncogenic potential.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16053918)" (2005) has a relative citation ratio of 0.12, and "[Preparation of the polyclonal antibody against KIAA0649 and its cellular localization.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20019768)" (2009) has a relative citation ratio of 0.01. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PPP1R26](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196422-PPP1R26) is a protein phosphatase inhibitor with evidence at the protein level. It is primarily located in the nucleoplasm and is detected in many tissues. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 29 for blood, Cluster 32 for endocrine and neural tissues, Cluster 51 for brain neurons, Cluster 43 for basic cellular processes in cell lines, and Cluster 72 for alveolar cells in the lung. The gene's expression in different cancer types is generally unprognostic.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), and [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667). Each of these TFs, except SP1, was shown to be regulating in 5 experiments, while SP1 was found in 4 experiments.




The gene PPP1R26 has been associated with [Schizophrenia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35396580), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Schizophrenia](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012559) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the pineal gland, amygdala, whole brain, fetal brain, and cingulate cortex, as well as in the medulla oblongata. Additionally, expression is observed in colorectal adenocarcinoma and fetal thyroid tissues.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.771 (13.18th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 15.55 at pH 7.0 (89.53rd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.018 (94.8th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 31.43% helix (45.09th percentile), 21.09% sheet (2.79th percentile), and 38.71% turn (96.14th percentile). Additionally, the protein has an instability index of 62.09 (86.52nd percentile), an isoelectric point of 8.84 (75.04th percentile), a length of 1209 amino acids (91.84th percentile), and a molecular weight of 127349.85 Da (90.69th percentile).
