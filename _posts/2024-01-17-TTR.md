The gene length is 198,485 base pairs (92.38% of all genes), the mature length is 1,119 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 92,634 base pairs (87.28% of all genes).


The gene TTR (NCBI ID: 7276) has been mentioned in [2,101 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TTR%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1961, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning TTR, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Tafamidis Treatment for Patients with Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30145929)" (2018) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 63.87, "[CRISPR-Cas9 In Vivo Gene Editing for Transthyretin Amyloidosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34215024)" (2021) with an RCR of 60.16, "[Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31171094)" (2019) with an RCR of 29.95, "[Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in continental Western Europe: an insight through the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30938420)" (2022) with an RCR of 26.14, and "[Safety and efficacy of RNAi therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23984729)" (2013) with an RCR of 21.46. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TTR](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000118271-TTR) is a gene involved in thyroid hormone function and has been implicated in various diseases, including amyloidosis, neuropathy, and cancer. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized to the Golgi apparatus. TTR is highly expressed in the choroid plexus, where it is involved in transmembrane transport, and in hepatocytes, where it plays a role in metabolism. Additionally, it is expressed in liver cancer cell lines, suggesting a role in cancer metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 5 experiments, [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 4 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 3 experiments, [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 3 experiments, and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including disease, physical disorder, orofacial cleft, and cleft lip.


The genome-wide association study has identified a link between the TTR gene and [Metabolite peak levels (QI722)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35995766). This association highlights the potential role of TTR in metabolic processes, although further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms involved.


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the pancreas, liver, and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), liver, retina, hypothalamus, thalamus, pancreatic islet, and fetal liver.


The input data highlights several pathways and processes, including diseases associated with visual transduction, visual phototransduction, retinoid metabolism and transport, the canonical retinoid cycle in rods (twilight vision), retinoid cycle disease events, amyloids, disease, signal transduction, extracellular matrix organization, and non-integrin membrane-ECM interactions.
