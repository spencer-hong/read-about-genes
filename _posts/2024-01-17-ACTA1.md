The gene ACTA1 (NCBI ID: 58) has been mentioned in [231 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ACTA1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1975, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning ACTA1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Type I collagen deletion in αSMA<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts augments immune suppression and accelerates progression of pancreatic cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33667385)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 22.41), "[Mutations and polymorphisms of the skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19562689)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 4.1), "[Analysis of αSMA-labeled progenitor cell commitment identifies notch signaling as an important pathway in fracture healing.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24190076)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 4.03), "[Revised Hammersmith Scale for spinal muscular atrophy: A SMA specific clinical outcome assessment tool.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28222119)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 3.33), and "[Human resident CD34+ stromal cells/telocytes have progenitor capacity and are a source of αSMA+ cells during repair.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25500909)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 2.98). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ACTA1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000143632-ACTA1) is a gene encoding a muscle protein with hydrolase activity. It is implicated in Nemaline myopathy, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. ACTA1 is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in striated muscle contraction. In the brain, it is involved in neuropeptide signaling in the hypothalamus. Additionally, ACTA1 is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, contributing to degranulation processes. In single-cell studies, it is found in skeletal myocytes, further emphasizing its role in muscle contraction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) were each found to be regulating in 3 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, muscle, and salivary gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, thyroid, prostate, fetal thyroid, skeletal muscle, tongue, and testis.




The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.232 (65.93rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -12.71 (18.35th percentile).
