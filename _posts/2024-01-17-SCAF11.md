The gene is involved in [spliceosomal complex assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000245) and [RNA splicing, via transesterification reactions](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000375), playing a crucial role in [mRNA processing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006397) and [RNA splicing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008380). It enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872). The gene is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), [nucleolus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005730), and [nuclear body](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016604).


The gene length is 21,913 base pairs (44.32% of all genes), the mature length is 680 base pairs (8.47% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 9,368 base pairs (31.58% of all genes).


The gene SCAF11, with NCBI ID 9169, has been mentioned in [19 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SCAF11%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 2006, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2016 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning SCAF11 include "[Improved de novo structure prediction in CASP11 by incorporating coevolution information into Rosetta.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26677056)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 3.3), "[New encouraging developments in contact prediction: Assessment of the CASP11 results.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26474083)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 2.83), "[Evaluation of free modeling targets in CASP11 and ROLL.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26677002)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 2.18), "[Performance of protein-structure predictions with the physics-based UNRES force field in CASP11.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27378298)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 1.95), and "[CASP11 statistics and the prediction center evaluation system.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26857434)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 1.44). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SCAF11](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000139218-SCAF11) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, nucleoli, and nuclear bodies. The gene is part of Cluster 32 in blood expression, specifically associated with basophils and transcription. In various tissues, cell lines, brain, and single cells, SCAF11 is part of non-specific transcription clusters. The gene is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma, among others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028) with 6 experiments, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) with 5 experiments, [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) with 5 experiments, [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908) with 5 experiments, and [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various cancer types, including lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, lung carcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. Additionally, the data highlights broader categories such as organ system cancer, respiratory system cancer, and diseases of cellular proliferation.


The genome-wide association study has identified a significant association between SCAF11 and [Hemoglobin levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327693), with the closest MeSH match being [Hemoglobins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006454). This association was determined using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method for embedding match.


The gene is expressed in various immune cell types, including BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells, as well as in tonsil tissue. Additionally, it is expressed in the ovary.



The mouse ortholog gene 72193 and its human ortholog gene 9169 are associated with abnormal bone structure, a phenotype observed in both sexes.
