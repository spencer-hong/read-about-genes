[EPB41L2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000079819-EPB41L2) is an actin-binding protein with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, and cell junctions. The gene is highly expressed in B-cells related to immunoglobulins, retina for visual perception, white matter involved in myelination, and stomach and colon cancer cell lines. Additionally, it is specifically expressed in photoreceptor cells, contributing to visual perception.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are highlighted. Metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, are also noted. Cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis, are prominent. Furthermore, the data includes neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, as well as conditions related to the urinary and nervous systems. Hypersensitivity reactions and diseases of the hematopoietic and immune systems are also represented.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including nerve and ovary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the retina, spinal cord, colon, ovary, and olfactory bulb.
