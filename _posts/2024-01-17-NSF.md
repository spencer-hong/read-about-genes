The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[NSF](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000073969-NSF) is a hydrolase with evidence at the protein level, implicated in disease variants of epilepsy and intellectual disability. It is detected in all RNA tissues and localizes to various subcellular locations including the Golgi apparatus, cytosol, and multiple segments of sperm cells. NSF is notably expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons and synapses, where it plays a role in synaptic function and signaling. Its expression is also observed in thyroid cancer cell lines and is associated with non-specific membrane trafficking in blood.

The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the amygdala, medulla oblongata, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and globus pallidus, as well as in the pituitary gland.


The input data highlights several pathways within the neuronal system, including transmission across chemical synapses, neurotransmitter receptor binding and downstream transmission in the postsynaptic cell, glutamate binding, activation of AMPA receptors and synaptic plasticity, as well as the trafficking of AMPA receptors, specifically those containing GluR2.


The mouse ortholog gene 18195 and its human ortholog gene 4905 are associated with several phenotypic outcomes. Notably, the mouse ortholog is linked to embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis and embryonic lethality prior to the tooth bud stage, both specific to one sex. Additionally, it is associated with preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which affects both sexes.
