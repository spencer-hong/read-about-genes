[ANXA3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000138772-ANXA3) is a phospholipase A2 inhibitor with evidence at the protein level. It is an FDA-approved drug target and is detected in all tissues. ANXA3 is primarily located in the plasma membrane and is highly expressed in neutrophils, where it is involved in degranulation. In terms of tissue expression, it is associated with cell proliferation in the bone marrow. Additionally, ANXA3 is expressed in the hindbrain, squamous epithelial cells, and various other cell types with mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) was found to be regulating in 4 experiments.


The transcription factor [23028](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028) was found to be regulating genes in one Perturb-seq experiment, according to data from GTRD's database of transcription factor binding sites and the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).


The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, bone inflammation disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bone disease, connective tissue disease, and musculoskeletal system disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the salivary gland and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the thyroid, whole blood, bronchial epithelial cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, salivary gland, bone marrow, and fetal lung.
