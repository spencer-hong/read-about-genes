Additionally, it enables [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872).


The gene length is 125,655 base pairs (86.01% of all genes), the mature length is 1,799 base pairs (47.17% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 32,675 base pairs (64.85% of all genes).


ARHGAP29 has been mentioned in [18 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ARHGAP29%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2005, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2014 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning ARHGAP29, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[YAP Regulates Actin Dynamics through ARHGAP29 and Promotes Metastasis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28538170)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 5.97), "[Rasip1 mediates Rap1 regulation of Rho in endothelial barrier function through ArhGAP29.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23798437)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 2.7), "[Expression and mutation analyses implicate ARHGAP29 as the etiologic gene for the cleft lip with or without cleft palate locus identified by genome-wide association on chromosome 1p22.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23008150)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 2.16), "[Rap1 Spatially Controls ArhGAP29 To Inhibit Rho Signaling during Endothelial Barrier Regulation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25963656)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.84), and "[Exome sequencing provides additional evidence for the involvement of ARHGAP29 in Mendelian orofacial clefting and extends the phenotypic spectrum to isolated cleft palate.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28029220)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.7). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ARHGAP29](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137962-ARHGAP29) is a gene with a molecular function in GTPase activation. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in adipose tissue and a mixed function cluster. Subcellularly, ARHGAP29 is localized to the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, centrosome, and cytosol. In the brain, it is part of a non-specific transcription cluster, while in kidney cancer cell lines, it is associated with membrane components. Single-cell expression analysis places it in a cluster with adipocytes and endothelial cells, also with mixed function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), and [GATAD2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57459), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, physical disorder, and orofacial cleft.



The gene is expressed in adipose tissue, breast, and thyroid according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, thyroid, smooth muscle, salivary gland, appendix, olfactory bulb, fetal lung, and lymph node.


The proteins are involved in the Rho GTPase cycle, signaling by Rho GTPases, and signal transduction pathways.


The mouse ortholog gene 214137 and its human ortholog 9411 are associated with phenotypes including embryonic lethality prior to the tooth bud stage, which is not observed in both sexes, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which is observed in both sexes.
