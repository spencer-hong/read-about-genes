The gene length is 5,550 base pairs (15.46% of all genes), the mature length is 814 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 4,275 base pairs.


The gene GSS (NCBI ID: 2937) has been mentioned in [65 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GSS%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1963, and the middle 50% of publications range from 1988 to 2011.


The top five publications mentioning GSS, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Prevalence and determinants of suicide ideation among Lebanese adolescents: results of the GSHS Lebanon 2005.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20434762)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 2.62), "[Assay of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase in erythrocytes by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1980497)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 2.08), "[The gamma-glutamyl cycle and amino acid transport. Studies of free amino acids, gamma-glutamyl-cysteine and glutathione in erythrocytes from patients with 5-oxoprolinuria (glutathione synthetase deficiency).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28482)" (1978) (relative citation ratio: 2.01), "[Microtubule assembly and function in normal and glutathione synthetase-deficient polymorphonuclear leukocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/641344)" (1978) (relative citation ratio: 1.79), and "[Mutations in the glutathione synthetase gene cause 5-oxoprolinuria.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8896573)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 1.72). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GSS](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100983-GSS) is a ligase involved in hereditary hemolytic anemia, with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. GSS is part of Cluster 33 in blood expression, associated with non-specific ATP binding, and Cluster 53 in tissue expression, linked to non-specific glycosylation. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 14, related to neurons and synaptic function. Additionally, GSS is found in Cluster 62 in cell line expression, associated with non-specific plasma proteins, and Cluster 56 in single-cell expression, related to proximal tubular cells and amino acid metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 4 experiments, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 4 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 4 experiments, [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 3 experiments, and [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, blood coagulation disease, inherited blood coagulation disease, and protein C deficiency.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the prostate, adrenal gland, colon, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), liver, and various cancer types such as Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), colorectal adenocarcinoma, and lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4).


The input data highlights various pathways and disorders related to biological oxidations and metabolism. Key pathways include biological oxidations, phase II conjugation, glutathione conjugation, and glutathione synthesis and recycling. Notable disorders linked to defective proteins are Hypermethioninemia with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency (HMAHCHD), hyperbilirubinemia caused by defective UGT1A1 and UGT1A4, Hemolytic anemia due to gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency (HAGGSD), Glutathionuria (GLUTH), Glutathione synthetase deficiency (GSS deficiency), Methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency (MATD), 5-oxoprolinase deficiency (OPLAHD), Schneckenbecken dysplasia (SCHBCKD), and Thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency (TPMT deficiency). These disorders are part of a broader category of metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes and are associated with disease.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.191 (70.08th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -7.74 (26.99th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.001 (46.83rd percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (37.55%, 87.19th percentile) and sheet structures (34.39%, 54.75th percentile), with a lower affinity for turn structures (25.74%, 27.0th percentile). The instability index is 54.77 (71.56th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.67 (22.1st percentile). The protein sequence is 474 amino acids long (54.96th percentile) with a molecular weight of 52384.18 Da (54.37th percentile).
