The gene is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739), specifically within the [mitochondrial inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005743) and the [mitochondrial matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005759). It is part of the [mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005753), particularly the [catalytic sector F(1)](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000275). The gene enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is involved in [oxidative phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006119), [ATP biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006754), and [proton motive force-driven ATP synthesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015986). Additionally, it contributes to [ATP hydrolysis activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016887) and [proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, rotational mechanism](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046933), and is involved in [proton transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902600).


The gene length is 87,185 base pairs (79.22 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 2,744 base pairs (68.46 percentile of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 80,356 base pairs (84.87 percentile of all genes).


There are no publications that mention this gene.



[ATP5F1C](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000165629-ATP5F1C) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 33 for blood (non-specific - ATP binding), Cluster 35 for tissue (non-specific - mitochondria), Cluster 25 for brain (non-specific - transcription), Cluster 52 for cell lines (non-specific - mitochondria), and Cluster 39 for single cells (non-specific - basic cellular processes). The gene is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma, among others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), [TAF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872), and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) and [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including general diseases, diseases of anatomical entities, kidney diseases, and urinary system diseases.


The gene ATP5F1C has been associated with [Alzheimer's disease (late onset)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28714976), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Alzheimer Disease](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004194) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, adrenal gland, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, adrenal gland, kidney, skeletal muscle, and various types of leukemia, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562) and promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60).


The input data highlights several key metabolic processes, including the formation of ATP by chemiosmotic coupling, respiratory electron transport, and the citric acid (TCA) cycle. These processes are integral to cellular metabolism and energy production.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.1799 (71.25th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 6.79 at pH 7.0 (73.64th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.002 (51.37th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 37.58% helix (87.34th percentile), 35.57% sheet (63.32nd percentile), and 25.84% turn (27.86th percentile). The instability index is 32.38 (6.26th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.23 (85.22nd percentile). The protein has a length of 298 amino acids (28.2nd percentile) and a molecular weight of 32995.66 Da (27.85th percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, as detailed [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
