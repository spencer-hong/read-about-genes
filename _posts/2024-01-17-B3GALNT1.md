The gene is located in the [Golgi membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000139) and is active in this cellular component. It is involved in several biological processes, including [protein O-linked glycosylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006493), [glycosphingolipid biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006688), and [oligosaccharide biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009312). Additionally, the gene enables [UDP-galactose:beta-N-acetylglucosamine beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008499) and [galactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide beta-D-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0047273).


The gene length is 12,236 base pairs (30.04% of all genes), the mature length is 4,225 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 12,236 base pairs.


The gene B3GALNT1 has been mentioned in [17 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22B3GALNT1%22) (note: the count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2013 and 2019.

[B3GALNT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000169255-B3GALNT1) is a gene with molecular functions including blood group antigen, glycosyltransferase, and transferase activities. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in vesicles. It is particularly expressed in basophils within the blood, heart muscle for tissue expression, neurons in the brain, and breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, it is found in cardiomyocytes at the single-cell level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 6 experiments, [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) with 5 experiments, [TRIM28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10155) with 5 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments, and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as breast cancer, thoracic cancer, and organ system cancer. Additionally, metabolic disorders are prominently featured, encompassing diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Cardiovascular system diseases and nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, are also implicated. Furthermore, the data highlights bone diseases, specifically osteoporosis, and connective tissue disorders.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, thyroid, and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), prefrontal cortex, thyroid, amygdala, fetal brain, and appendix.
