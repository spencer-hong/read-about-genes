The gene length is 90,182 base pairs (79.85th percentile), the mature length is 2,073 base pairs (54.65th percentile), and the primary transcript length is 11,132 base pairs (36.15th percentile).


The gene EXOC5, with NCBI ID 10640, has been mentioned in [8 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22EXOC5%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning EXOC5, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[The exocyst protein Sec10 is necessary for primary ciliogenesis and cystogenesis in vitro.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19297529)" (2009) (RCR: 2.68), "[Erratum. Microvascular Complications and Foot Care. Sec. 10. In <i>Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes-2017</i>. Diabetes Care 2017;40(Suppl. 1);S88-S98.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28522554)" (2017) (RCR: 1.91), "[Identification and characterization of homologues of the Exocyst component Sec10p.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9119050)" (1997) (RCR: 0.51), "[The exocyst gene Sec10 regulates renal epithelial monolayer homeostasis and apoptotic sensitivity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26040895)" (2015) (RCR: 0.41), and "[Crystal structure of Sec10, a subunit of the exocyst complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28098232)" (2017) (RCR: 0.39). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[EXOC5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000070367-EXOC5) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized in vesicles. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 33 for blood expression, Cluster 16 for tissue expression, Cluster 21 for brain expression, Cluster 30 for cell line expression, and Cluster 11 for single cell expression, specifically in late spermatids. The gene's prognostic value in various cancers is unprognostic, indicating no significant correlation with patient outcomes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066), and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, and broader cardiovascular system diseases. Additionally, there are links to hypertension and various mental health disorders, such as substance-related disorders, substance dependence, alcohol dependence, and alcohol abuse.

The gene is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, blood vessel, bladder, and skin. Additionally, it is expressed in specific cell types such as 721_B_lymphoblasts, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD8+ T cells, and multiple cell types within the testis, including interstitial cells, Leydig cells, and germ cells.


The input data highlights several key biological processes, including metabolism of proteins, assembly of the primary cilium, organelle biogenesis and maintenance, insulin processing, peptide hormone metabolism, membrane trafficking, translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, cargo trafficking to the periciliary membrane, and VxPx cargo-targeting to cilium.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.395 (46.68th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -6.71 (29.14th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.003 (53.15th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 35.31% helix (76.69th percentile), 35.73% sheet (64.45th percentile), and 22.18% turn (7.02nd percentile).
