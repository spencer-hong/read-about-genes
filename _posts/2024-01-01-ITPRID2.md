The gene length is 444,327 base pairs (97.89% of all genes), the mature length is 4,529 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 444,057 base pairs.


The gene ITPRID2, with NCBI ID 6744, has been the subject of [20 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ITPRID2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication dating back to 1985. The middle 50% of these publications were published between 2007 and 2021. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning ITPRID2, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include: ["CS1-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered natural killer cells enhance in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity against human multiple myeloma."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24067492) (2014) (RCR: 9.25), ["The minimal essential sequence for a major cell type-specific adhesion site (CS1) within the alternatively spliced type III connecting segment domain of fibronectin is leucine-aspartic acid-valine."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1869542) (1991) (RCR: 7.13), ["KRAP tethers IP<sub>3</sub> receptors to actin and licenses them to evoke cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34301929) (2021) (RCR: 2.41), ["Antibodies derived from an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) adhesin tip MEFA (multiepitope fusion antigen) against adherence of nine ETEC adhesins: CFA/I, CS1, CS2, CS3, CS4, CS5, CS6, CS21 and EtpA."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27228947) (2016) (RCR: 1.71), and ["Co-administered Tag-Less Toxoid Fusion 3xSTa<sub>N12S</sub>-mnLT<sub>R192G/L211A</sub> and CFA/I/II/IV MEFA (Multiepitope Fusion Antigen) Induce Neutralizing Antibodies to 7 Adhesins (CFA/I, CS1-CS6) and Both Enterotoxins (LT, STa) of Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC)."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29922268) (2018) (RCR: 1.43). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) and [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313), each with 6 experiments, followed by [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), also with 6 experiments. Additionally, [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.655 (20.76th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -51.84 (2.28th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.012 (86.35th percentile). The protein has a high instability index of 67.70 (92.99th percentile) and an isoelectric point of 5.11 (9.75th percentile).
