The gene is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739) and specifically in the [mitochondrial inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005743). It is part of the [mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase, stator stalk](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000274) and the [mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005753). The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and contributes to [proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, rotational mechanism](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046933). It is involved in [proton motive force-driven ATP synthesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015986), [proton motive force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042776), and [proton transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902600).


The gene length is 123,881.0 base pairs (85.8% of all genes), the mature length is 620.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 54,929.5 base pairs.


The gene ATP5PD (NCBI ID: 10476) has been mentioned in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ATP5PD%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2014, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2017 and 2019.


The top publications mentioning ATP5PD include "[ATP5H/KCTD2 locus is associated with Alzheimer's disease risk.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23857120)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 1.74), "[Mitochondrial reprogramming via ATP5H loss promotes multimodal cancer therapy resistance.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30124467)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 1.26), "[Circ-ATP5H Induces Hepatitis B Virus Replication and Expression by Regulating miR-138-5p/<i>TNFAIP3</i> Axis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33173336)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.18), and "[Amorphous silica nanoparticles induce tumorigenesis via regulating ATP5H/SOD1-related oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation and EIF4G2/PABPC1-associated translational initiation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30863671)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 0.43). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ATP5PD](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000167863-ATP5PD) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily located in the mitochondria and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 10 for blood (non-specific - membrane trafficking), Cluster 23 for tissue (non-specific - cellular respiration), Cluster 21 for brain (non-specific - metabolism), Cluster 27 for cell lines (breast cancer - unknown function), and Cluster 68 for single cells (cardiomyocytes - muscle contraction). The gene is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma, among others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088) with 6 experiments, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) and [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757) each with 5 experiments, and [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908) and [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886) each with 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorders and diseases of mental health.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, muscle, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland during the day, heart, temporal lobe, and skeletal muscle.


The input data highlights several key metabolic processes, including the formation of ATP by chemiosmotic coupling, respiratory electron transport, and the citric acid (TCA) cycle. These processes are integral to cellular metabolism and energy production.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.554 (29.55th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -4.39 (35.29th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.011 (83.38th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (0.453, 98.48th percentile), with lower affinities for sheet (0.329, 44.92nd percentile) and turn (0.236, 12.96th percentile) structures.
