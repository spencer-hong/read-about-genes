[EPB41](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000159023-EPB41) is a gene with actin-binding and calmodulin-binding molecular functions. It is implicated in diseases such as elliptocytosis, hereditary hemolytic anemia, and pyropoikilocytosis. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in various subcellular locations including nuclear bodies, plasma membrane, cell junctions, cytokinetic bridge, mitotic spindle, and cytosol. It is part of Cluster 42 for blood expression, Cluster 16 for tissue expression, Cluster 15 for brain expression, Cluster 12 for cell line expression, and Cluster 55 for single cell expression, all of which are associated with non-specific transcription or vesicular transport.
