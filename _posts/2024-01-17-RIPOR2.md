The gene RIPOR2 (NCBI Gene ID: 9750) has been mentioned in [11 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RIPOR2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2013 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning RIPOR2 are as follows: [Murine Fam65b forms ring-like structures at the base of stereocilia critical for mechanosensory hair cell function.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27269051) (2016) (relative citation ratio: 1.08), [Fam65b is a new transcriptional target of FOXO1 that regulates RhoA signaling for T lymphocyte migration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23241886) (2013) (relative citation ratio: 0.82), [Fam65b is important for formation of the HDAC6-dysferlin protein complex during myogenic cell differentiation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24687993) (2014) (relative citation ratio: 0.63), [Fam65b Phosphorylation Relieves Tonic RhoA Inhibition During T Cell Migration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30254631) (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.62), and [C6ORF32 is upregulated during muscle cell differentiation and induces the formation of cellular filopodia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17150207) (2007) (relative citation ratio: 0.61). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RIPOR2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111913-RIPOR2) is a developmental protein and signal transduction inhibitor, with evidence at the protein level. It is implicated in deafness and non-syndromic deafness. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in the cytosol. RIPOR2 is expressed in neutrophils with unknown function (Cluster 21) and is associated with immune response in lymphoid tissue (Cluster 70). In the brain, it is found in neurons with mixed function (Cluster 33), and in cell lines, it is linked to lymphoma and humoral immune response (Cluster 46). Single-cell expression data indicates its involvement in neutrophil degranulation (Cluster 74).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), and [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) was found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, disease of metabolism, acquired metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism disease, glucose metabolism disease, diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, kidney disease, urinary system disease, cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, psychotic disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcohol-induced mental disorder, and substance-induced psychosis.


The gene RIPOR2 has been associated with [Mean reticulocyte volume](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Reticulocytes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012156) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus, blood, and spleen. Additionally, it is expressed in multiple immune cell types such as CD33+ myeloid cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (negatively selected), and CD14+ monocytes, as well as in whole blood.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.405 (45.6th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -31.59 (5.75th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.007 (73.12th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix (36.42%, 82.75th percentile) and sheet (33.24%, 46.94th percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (29.31%, 58.43rd percentile). The instability index is 56.53 (75.95th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.29 (13.2nd percentile). The protein is 1068 amino acids long (89.2nd percentile) with a molecular weight of 118517.38 Da (89.08th percentile).
