The gene length is 3,521 base pairs (9.8% of all genes), the mature length is 911 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 3,184 base pairs.


The gene TGFA (NCBI ID: 7039) has been mentioned in [7,384 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TGFA%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning TGFA is 1967, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2006 and 2018.


The top five publications mentioning TGFA, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mechanisms of TGF-beta signaling from cell membrane to the nucleus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12809600)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 88.98), "[TGF-Î²: the master regulator of fibrosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27108839)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 84.59), "[Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways in TGF-beta family signalling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14534577)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 82.31), "[TGF-beta signal transduction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9759503)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 77.22), and "[TGF-beta signalling from cell membrane to nucleus through SMAD proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9393997)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 66.24). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TGFA](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000163235-TGFA) is a growth factor and mitogen involved in cancer-related genes. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in vesicles. Its expression is associated with Cluster 21 in neutrophils, Cluster 34 in non-specific tissues, Cluster 30 in brain white matter related to myelination, Cluster 15 in kidney cancer cell lines, and Cluster 45 in non-specific single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 6 experiments, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) with 5 experiments, [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113) with 5 experiments, [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757) with 5 experiments, and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as those caused by viral agents, specifically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Additionally, the data highlights hematopoietic and immune system diseases, as well as metabolic disorders, particularly those related to carbohydrate and glucose metabolism, including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nutritional diseases, notably overnutrition and obesity, are also implicated. Cardiovascular system diseases, including hypertension and various artery diseases, are prominent. Furthermore, the data points to nervous system diseases, with a focus on neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, and cognitive disorders. Cerebral arterial diseases, including intracranial aneurysms and cerebrovascular diseases, are also noted.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the vagina and salivary gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the retina, whole blood, bronchial epithelial cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, pancreas, superior cervical ganglion, and dorsal root ganglion.
