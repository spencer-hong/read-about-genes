The gene LPP (NCBI ID: 4026) has been mentioned in [41 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22LPP%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning LPP was in 1992, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2005 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning LPP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[MicL, a new ÏƒE-dependent sRNA, combats envelope stress by repressing synthesis of Lpp, the major outer membrane lipoprotein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25030700)" (2014) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 6.09, "[Cancer-associated fibroblasts regulate endothelial adhesion protein LPP to promote ovarian cancer chemoresistance.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29251630)" (2018) with an RCR of 4.03, "[LPP, the preferred fusion partner gene of HMGIC in lipomas, is a novel member of the LIM protein gene family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8812423)" (1996) with an RCR of 3.39, "[Generalization of reappraisal to novel negative stimuli as evidenced by the LPP.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35421450)" (2022) with an RCR of 2.68, and "[Influence of trait behavioral inhibition and behavioral approach motivation systems on the LPP and frontal asymmetry to anger pictures.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23175676)" (2014) with an RCR of 2.26. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[LPP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000145012-LPP) is a gene that functions as an activator and is implicated in cancer-related processes. Evidence for its involvement is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in the plasma membrane, focal adhesion sites, and cytosol. It is expressed in various clusters, including dendritic cells with unknown function, smooth muscle tissue involved in ECM organization, non-specific vasculature in the brain, lymphoma related to humoral immune response, and smooth muscle cells involved in muscle contraction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024), [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), and [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688). Each of these TFs, except SPI1, was shown to be regulating in 5 experiments, while SPI1 was found in 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as breast cancer, thoracic cancer, male reproductive organ cancer, testicular cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, hematologic cancer, immune system cancer, and lymphoma. Additionally, the data highlights respiratory system diseases like asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, and lung disease. Metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular system diseases including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart disease are also noted. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia are included, along with mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Furthermore, the data encompasses musculoskeletal system diseases like arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases like celiac disease, and genetic disorders such as long QT syndrome. Other conditions mentioned include prostate disease, prostatic hypertrophy, Hodgkin's lymphoma, vitiligo, gallbladder disease, and smallpox.


The genome-wide association studies have identified several traits and diseases associated with LPP. Notably, [Chronic kidney disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29124443) has been mapped to the closest MeSH term [Renal Insufficiency, Chronic](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D051436) using a method called [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0). Additionally, [Creatinine levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29124443) and [Estimated glomerular filtration rate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29124443) have been associated with the MeSH terms [Creatinine](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D003404) and [Filtration](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005374), respectively. Furthermore, [Intraocular pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29235454) has been directly mapped to the MeSH term [Intraocular Pressure](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007429).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the prostate, colon, small intestine, appendix, uterus, and testis (both interstitial and germ cells). Additionally, it is expressed in blood vessels.



The mouse ortholog gene 210126, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 4026, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal body fat mass and abnormal lean body mass, both observed in a sex-specific manner. Additionally, the gene is linked to abnormal liver morphology, abnormal optic disk morphology, abnormal retina blood vessel morphology, abnormal retina vasculature morphology, and increased circulating phosphate level, all of which are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.589 (26.28th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 0.785 at pH 7.0 (53.02nd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.011 (83.32nd percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 23.4% helix (2.84th percentile), 27.5% sheet (16.14th percentile), and 39.2% turn (96.72nd percentile). With an instability index of 58.13 (79.42nd percentile), an isoelectric point of 7.18 (52.21st percentile), a length of 612 amino acids (69.44th percentile), and a molecular weight of 65745.64 Da (67.68th percentile), this protein's properties were calculated using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
