[OCRL](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000122126-OCRL) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function. It is implicated in various diseases, including cataract, ciliopathy, and disease variants, with evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in multiple subcellular locations, including microtubules, primary cilium, centriolar satellite, basal body, and cytosol. OCRL is expressed in specific clusters related to monocytes and innate immune response in blood, flagellum assembly in spermatids, mixed function in the choroid plexus of the brain, mRNA processing in non-specific cell lines, and transcription in ovarian stromal cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1051), and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the prefrontal cortex, thyroid, hypothalamus, pituitary, testis, and testis germ cells.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to metabolism, including lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, and inositol phosphate metabolism. They also play roles in signal transduction, particularly through Rho GTPase signaling and cycling. Additionally, these proteins participate in membrane trafficking processes such as clathrin-derived vesicle budding, trans-Golgi network vesicle budding, and Golgi-associated vesicle biogenesis. Specific metabolic processes include the synthesis of IP3 and IP4 in the cytosol, synthesis of IP2, IP, and Ins in the cytosol, PI metabolism, and synthesis of PIPs at the Golgi membrane.
