[NUDT21](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000167005-NUDT21) is an RNA-binding protein with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in nuclear bodies and centriolar satellites. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 5 in blood, associated with non-specific cell proliferation, and Cluster 16 in tissues, linked to non-specific transcription. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 14, involved in neurons and synaptic function. Additionally, NUDT21 is found in Cluster 68 in cell lines, related to cell cycle regulation, and Cluster 11 in single cells, associated with late spermatids of unknown function.

The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, disease of metabolism, acquired metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism disease, glucose metabolism disease, diabetes mellitus, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, broader categories such as disease and disease of anatomical entity are also noted.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, B lymphoblasts, CD105+ endothelial cells, and multiple testicular cell types such as interstitial cells and Leydig cells.


The input data highlights various processes involved in gene expression and RNA processing. These include RNA polymerase II transcription, transcription termination, and post-elongation processing of both intron-containing and intronless pre-mRNAs. Specific processes mentioned are mRNA 3'-end processing, mRNA splicing, and the major pathway of mRNA splicing. Additionally, the data covers the cleavage of growing transcripts in the termination region and the processing of capped intronless and intron-containing pre-mRNAs.


The mouse ortholog gene 68219 and its human ortholog gene 11051 are associated with phenotypes including embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, which is not observed in both sexes, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which is observed in both sexes.
