The gene is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). It is involved in the [G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007186) and the [G protein-coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035589). Additionally, it enables [G protein-coupled purinergic nucleotide receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045028) and [G protein-coupled UDP receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045029).


The gene length is 27,721.0 base pairs (50.5% of all genes), the mature length is 3,923.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 27,700.5 base pairs.


The gene P2RY14, with NCBI ID 9934, has been mentioned in [61 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22P2RY14%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning P2RY14, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Characterization of the UDP-glucose receptor (re-named here the P2Y14 receptor) adds diversity to the P2Y receptor family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12559763)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 7.19), "[Proinflammatory P2Y14 receptor inhibition protects against ischemic acute kidney injury in mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32287042)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 4.57), "[Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. I. The coding sequences of 40 new genes (KIAA0001-KIAA0040) deduced by analysis of randomly sampled cDNA clones from human immature myeloid cell line KG-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7584026)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 3.96), "[The purinergic P2Y14 receptor links hepatocyte death to hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis in the liver.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35385339)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 3.15), and "[A selective high-affinity antagonist of the P2Y14 receptor inhibits UDP-glucose-stimulated chemotaxis of human neutrophils.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23592514)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 2.99). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[P2RY14](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000174944-P2RY14) is a G-protein coupled receptor with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in the placenta during pregnancy, as well as in the choroid plexus of the brain. In single cells, it is found in dendritic cells involved in antigen presentation. The gene is also expressed in the HMC-1 cell line, which is associated with the innate immune response. However, its expression in blood is non-specific with an unknown function. The gene has been found to be unprognostic in various cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and testicular germ cell tumor.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), and [TCF12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6938) were each found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorder, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the bladder, small intestine, and stomach, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the retina, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), whole blood, colon, and small intestine.


The input data includes various pathways and processes involving GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors), such as rhodopsin-like receptors, GPCR ligand binding, and downstream signaling events. Specific pathways mentioned include G alpha (i) signaling, nucleotide-like (purinergic) receptors, and P2Y receptors. Additionally, the data highlights metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes and diseases related to defective ACTH, which causes obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (POMCD). These pathways are integral to signal transduction processes.


The mouse ortholog gene 140795 corresponds to the human ortholog gene 9934.0. Notably, the mouse phenotype associated with this gene is 'long tibia', and this phenotype is not observed in both sexes.
