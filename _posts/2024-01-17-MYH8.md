[MYH8](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000133020-MYH8) is a multifunctional gene with roles in actin-binding, calmodulin-binding, and motor protein activity, primarily functioning as a muscle protein and myosin. It is implicated in disease variants and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in some RNA tissue distributions and is localized to focal adhesion sites. MYH8 is expressed in tissue cluster 19, which is involved in basic cellular processes, and in cell line cluster 5, which has an unknown function. Notably, it is highly expressed in skeletal myocytes, contributing to muscle contraction. The gene's prognostic value in various cancers is generally unprognostic, except for Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA), where it is also unprognostic.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5971), [SNAI2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6591), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1051), and [INTS11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54973), each shown to be regulating in one experiment.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of mental health diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, salivary gland, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, liver, appendix, superior cervical ganglion, skeletal muscle, atrioventricular node, and ciliary ganglion.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including muscle contraction, striated muscle contraction, membrane trafficking, and the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane.


The mouse ortholog gene 17885 and its human ortholog gene 4626 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities observed in both sexes, including abnormal embryo size, abnormal sternum morphology, decreased hematocrit, edema, enlarged urinary bladder, and complete penetrance preweaning lethality.
