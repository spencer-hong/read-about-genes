The gene is involved in [hair follicle development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001942) and [oocyte differentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009994). It enables [transmembrane signaling receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004888) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), but does not enable [G protein-coupled receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004930). The gene is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and is active in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). Additionally, it is involved in the [G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007186), [adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007189), [activation of adenylate cyclase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007190), [regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042127), [inner ear development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048839), [positive regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0090263), and [epithelial cell proliferation involved in renal tubule morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:2001013). The gene also enables [G protein-coupled peptide receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008528) and [protein-hormone receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016500), and is located in the [trans-Golgi network membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032588).


The gene length is 33,219 base pairs (55.41% of all genes), the mature length is 4,634 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 33,215 base pairs.


The gene LGR5 (NCBI ID: 8549) has been mentioned in [356 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22LGR5%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2003 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2014 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning LGR5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19329995)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 95.94), "[Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20887898)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 27.49), "[Lgr5(+ve) stem cells drive self-renewal in the stomach and build long-lived gastric units in vitro.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20085740)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 25.05), "[A reserve stem cell population in small intestine renders Lgr5-positive cells dispensable.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21927002)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 18.79), and "[A distinct role for Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells in primary and metastatic colon cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28358093)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 17.13). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[LGR5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000139292-LGR5) is a G-protein coupled receptor with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, vesicles, primary cilium transition zone, centrosome, and basal body. LGR5 is expressed in skeletal muscle, involved in muscle contraction, and in white matter, associated with myelination. In cell lines, it is found in thyroid cancer, linked to neuronal signaling, and in single cells, it is present in glandular and luminal cells with an unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [KDM2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/84678), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [BMAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/406) and [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, heart conduction disease, and familial atrial fibrillation.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle and nerve, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Cardiac Myocytes, Spinal Cord, Placenta, Superior Cervical Ganglion, Atrioventricular Node, Ciliary Ganglion, and Dorsal Root Ganglion.


The input data highlights various pathways and processes related to WNT signaling, including the regulation of FZD by ubiquitination, enhanced WNT signaling and proliferation by RNF mutants, TCF-dependent signaling in response to WNT, and the stabilization of AXIN by XAV939 through tankyrase inhibition. Additionally, misspliced LRP5 mutants exhibit enhanced beta-catenin-dependent signaling. The data also covers broader categories such as signaling by WNT in cancer, general WNT signaling, disease, and signal transduction.


The mouse ortholog gene 14160 and its human ortholog 8549 are associated with several phenotypes, including cleft palate, increased grip strength, no spontaneous movement, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.
