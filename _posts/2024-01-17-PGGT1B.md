The gene enables [protein geranylgeranyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004661) and contributes to [CAAX-protein geranylgeranyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004662). It is also involved in [protein geranylgeranylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0018344). The gene is part of the [CAAX-protein geranylgeranyltransferase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005953) and enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [zinc ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008270).


The gene length is 20,395 base pairs (42.5% of all genes), the mature length is 3,602.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 16,269.5 base pairs.


The gene PGGT1B, with NCBI ID 5229, has been mentioned in [8 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PGGT1B%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 2010, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2013 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning PGGT1B include "[Inhibiting PGGT1B Disrupts Function of RHOA, Resulting in T-cell Expression of Integrin α4β7 and Development of Colitis in Mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31302143)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 0.83), "[Endothelial protective genes induced by statin are mimicked by ERK5 activation as triggered by a drug combination of FTI-277 and GGTI-298.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25829196)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 0.58), "[The Role of Geranylgeranyltransferase I-Mediated Protein Prenylation in the Brain.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26666664)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 0.51), "[Geranylgeranyltransferase I regulates HIF-1α promoting glioblastoma cell migration and invasion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23475391)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 0.36), and "[Simvastatin and GGTI-2133, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, increase erythrocyte deformability but reduce low O(2) tension-induced ATP release.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23335799)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 0.34). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PGGT1B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000164219-PGGT1B) is a gene encoding a protein with prenyltransferase and transferase molecular functions. Evidence for this protein is available at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol. It is part of Cluster 10 in blood expression, which is non-specific and related to membrane trafficking. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 37, which is associated with the liver and intestine, playing a role in lipid metabolism. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 21, which is non-specific and related to metabolism. In cell lines, it is part of Cluster 22, which is non-specific and related to mRNA splicing and the cell cycle. Additionally, it is part of Cluster 66 in single-cell expression, which is specific to photoreceptor cells and involved in visual perception.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 5 experiments, [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) and [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024) each with 4 experiments, and [GATA6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2627) and [E2F6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1876) each with 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various metabolic and nutritional conditions, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, nutrition diseases, overnutrition, and obesity.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including breast, adrenal gland, and colon, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Adrenal Cortex, Appendix, Superior Cervical Ganglion, Trigeminal Ganglion, Skeletal Muscle, Atrioventricular Node, and Ciliary Ganglion.
