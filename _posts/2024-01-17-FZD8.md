The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [angiogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001525), [positive regulation of protein phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001934), [neuron differentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030182), [T cell differentiation in thymus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0033077), and both [canonical](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060070) and [non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035567). It enables several molecular functions, such as [G protein-coupled receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004930), [signaling receptor binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005102), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [Wnt-protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0017147), [PDZ domain binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030165), [ubiquitin protein ligase binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031625), and [Wnt receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042813). The gene is located in the [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and [neuronal dense core vesicle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0098992), and is part of the [Wnt-Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990851).


The gene length is 164,998 base pairs (90.24% of all genes), the mature length is 2,603 base pairs (65.9% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 130,176 base pairs (91.94% of all genes).


The gene FZD8 (NCBI ID: 8325) has been mentioned in [26 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FZD8%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2001 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2012 and 2017. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning FZD8, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human-chimpanzee differences in a FZD8 enhancer alter cell-cycle dynamics in the developing neocortex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25702574)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 4.34), "[Reconstitution of a frizzled8.Wnt3a.LRP6 signaling complex reveals multiple Wnt and Dkk1 binding sites on LRP6.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20093360)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 3.57), "[An antiproliferative factor from interstitial cystitis patients is a frizzled 8 protein-related sialoglycopeptide.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15282374)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 3.35), "[Frizzled-8 integrates Wnt-11 and transforming growth factor-β signaling in prostate cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717114)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 2.99), and "[Long noncoding RNA AK126698 inhibits proliferation and migration of non-small cell lung cancer cells by targeting Frizzled-8 and suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27445486)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 2.79). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[FZD8](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000177283-FZD8) is a developmental protein that functions as a G-protein coupled receptor and transducer. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and primary cilium. FZD8 is notably expressed in the choroid plexus, where it is involved in transmembrane transport, and in alveolar cells, contributing to lung function. Evidence for FZD8 is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 4 experiments, [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 4 experiments, [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733) with 4 experiments, and [E2F6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1876) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the spleen, prefrontal cortex, cardiac myocytes, heart, and liver. Additionally, it is expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji) cells.


The input data highlights various pathways and processes, including the regulation of FZD by ubiquitination, asymmetric localization of PCP proteins, and the PCP/CE pathway. It also covers beta-catenin independent WNT signaling, the impact of RNF mutants on WNT signaling and proliferation, and TCF dependent signaling in response to WNT. Additionally, it mentions the effect of XAV939 on tankyrase and AXIN stabilization, as well as the enhanced beta-catenin-dependent signaling in misspliced LRP5 mutants. The data also includes signaling by WNT in cancer, general WNT signaling, and processes involving Class B/2 (Secretin family receptors). Furthermore, it touches on defective ACTH causing obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (POMCD), GPCR ligand binding, metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes, and general disease processes. Lastly, it covers signaling by GPCR and signal transduction.


The mouse gene with NCBI ID 14370 and its human ortholog with NCBI ID 8325 are associated with the phenotype of a thick ventricular wall, observed in both sexes.
