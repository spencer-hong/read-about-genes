The gene NOS1AP has been mentioned in [110 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NOS1AP%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1937, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning NOS1AP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A common genetic variant in the NOS1 regulator NOS1AP modulates cardiac repolarization.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16648850)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 7.76), "[CAPON: a protein associated with neuronal nitric oxide synthase that regulates its interactions with PSD95.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9459447)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 6.14), "[NOS1AP is a genetic modifier of the long-QT syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19822806)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 4.16), "[Implementing capon beamforming on a GPU for real-time cardiac ultrasound imaging.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24402897)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 3.37), and "[Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) and its adaptor, NOS1AP, as a genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25612209)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 3.06). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[NOS1AP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198929-NOS1AP) is a gene with evidence at the protein level and is implicated in disease variants. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and vesicles. The gene is highly expressed in the brain, specifically in neurons involved in synaptic signal transduction and mixed functions. It is also expressed in neuronal cell lines associated with visual perception and single-cell clusters involved in neuronal signaling. While NOS1AP is unprognostic for several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma, its expression patterns suggest a significant role in neuronal functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as those caused by viral agents and human immunodeficiency virus, as well as hematopoietic and immune system disorders. Metabolic diseases, particularly those related to carbohydrate and glucose metabolism, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, are also implicated. Cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease and vascular disease are noted, along with kidney and urinary system diseases. Mental health disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance dependence, are additionally linked. Furthermore, the data highlights associations with musculoskeletal system diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, genetic disorders such as long QT syndrome, and communication disorders including language and reading disorders.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including breast, brain, and stomach, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), prefrontal cortex, amygdala, cingulate cortex, subthalamic nucleus, and cerebellum.
