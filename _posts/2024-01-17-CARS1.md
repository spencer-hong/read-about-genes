The gene length is 12,711 base pairs (31.06% of all genes), the mature length is 789 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 12,612 base pairs.


The gene CARS1 (NCBI ID: 833) has been mentioned in [196 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CARS1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1889 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1990 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning CARS1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Sir Isaac Newton, sepsis, SIRS, and CARS.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8674323)" (1996) with a relative citation ratio of 18.78, "[Cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase governs cysteine polysulfidation and mitochondrial bioenergetics.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29079736)" (2017) with a relative citation ratio of 14.74, "[CARS temperature and species measurements in augmented jet engine exhausts.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18212828)" (1984) with a relative citation ratio of 6.63, "[Mode noise in broadband CARS spectroscopy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18217050)" (1985) with a relative citation ratio of 4.52, and "[Rotational CARS generation through a multiple four-color interaction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18235814)" (1986) with a relative citation ratio of 4.21. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CARS1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110619-CARS1) is a gene encoding a protein with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and ligase molecular functions. It is involved in various diseases, including cancer-related genes, disease variants, dwarfism, and is considered a proto-oncogene. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, and its protein is primarily located in the cytosol. CARS1 is part of several expression clusters, including Cluster 33 for blood (non-specific - ATP binding), Cluster 68 for tissue (non-specific - protein processing), Cluster 45 for brain (non-specific - mixed function), Cluster 13 for cell line (non-specific - mixed function), and Cluster 42 for single cell (ciliated cells - cilium assembly).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [THAP11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57215), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus, and carbohydrate and glucose metabolism diseases. Additionally, there are associations with cardiovascular system diseases, including artery disease, vascular disease, and arteriosclerosis. Kidney and urinary system diseases, such as kidney failure and chronic kidney failure, are also implicated. Furthermore, the data highlights links to nervous system diseases, including cognitive disorders and mental health conditions like bipolar disorder and mood disorders. Substance-related disorders, specifically alcohol dependence, are also noted. Lastly, mineral metabolism diseases, including calcium metabolism disease, and brain diseases are part of the associated conditions.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), B lymphoblasts (721), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), bronchial epithelial cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma. Additionally, it is expressed in skin tissue.


The input data indicates involvement in several biological processes, including gene expression, cytosolic tRNA aminoacylation, and tRNA aminoacylation.
