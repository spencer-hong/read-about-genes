The gene is located in the [stress fiber](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001725), [Z disc](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030018), [I band](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031674), and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). It enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [tropomyosin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005523), [cytoskeletal protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008092), [filamin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031005), and [actin filament binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051015). Additionally, it serves as a [structural constituent of muscle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008307) and is involved in [cardiac muscle thin filament assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071691).


The gene length is 31,303 base pairs (53.85% of all genes), the mature length is 1,286 base pairs (31.51% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 25,662.5 base pairs (58.5% of all genes).


The gene NEBL (NCBI ID: 10529) has been mentioned in [21 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NEBL%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning NEBL was in 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning NEBL, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Characterization of nebulette and nebulin and emerging concepts of their roles for vertebrate Z-discs.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9733644)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 2.51), "[LASP2 inhibits trophoblast cell migration and invasion in preeclampsia through inactivation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32635793)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.62), "[LASP2 suppresses colorectal cancer progression through JNK/p38 MAPK pathway meditated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28606091)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.46), "[Identification and characterization of LASP2 gene in silico.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12883659)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 1.45), and "[LIM-Nebulette Reinforces Podocyte Structural Integrity by Linking Actin and Vimentin Filaments.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32737144)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.24). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[NEBL](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000078114-NEBL) is an actin-binding protein with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is particularly associated with heart muscle and heart development, as indicated by its expression in Cluster 30. In the brain, NEBL shows non-specific expression with mixed function (Cluster 44), while in cell lines, it is found in Rhabdoid cells with unknown function (Cluster 5). At the single-cell level, NEBL is expressed in cardiomyocytes, contributing to muscle contraction (Cluster 68).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341), and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as lung cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory system diseases like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are highlighted. Metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity, are also noted. Cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and vascular disease are present. Furthermore, the data includes neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, and dementia, as well as mental health conditions such as major depressive disorder and mood disorder.


Genome-wide association studies have linked the NEBL gene to several cardiac conditions. Specifically, NEBL has been associated with [Arrhythmia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32514122), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Arrhythmias, Cardiac](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001145) through a synonym direct match. Additionally, NEBL is implicated in [Atrial fibrillation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28416822), directly matching the MeSH term [Atrial Fibrillation](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001281). Furthermore, NEBL is associated with [Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594039), which maps to the MeSH term [Tachycardia](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013610) through an embedding match using [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, spinal cord, subthalamic nucleus, cerebellum peduncles, salivary gland, and pituitary.
