The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [plasma cell differentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002317), [apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006915), [T cell costimulation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031295), and [positive regulation of apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043065). It enables functions such as [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [laminin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043236). The gene is located in multiple cellular components, including the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [endoplasmic reticulum lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005788), and [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829). Additionally, it is part of the [galectin complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990724) and colocalizes with the [collagen-containing extracellular matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0062023). The gene is also involved in [myoblast differentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045445), [positive regulation of viral entry into host cell](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046598), and [positive regulation of inflammatory response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050729). Notably, it is not involved in the [positive regulation of dendritic cell differentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:2001200).


The gene length is 48,464 base pairs (65.43% of all genes), the mature length is 2,024 base pairs (53.38% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 38,051 base pairs (68.65% of all genes).


The gene LGALS1 (NCBI ID: 3956) has been mentioned in [1,038 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22LGALS1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1964, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2016.


The top 5 publications mentioning LGALS1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Apoptosis of T cells mediated by galectin-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7501023)" (1995) with a relative citation ratio of 18.31, "[Galectin-1: a small protein with major functions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16840800)" (2006) with a relative citation ratio of 13.99, "[Galectin-1 deactivates classically activated microglia and protects from inflammation-induced neurodegeneration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22884314)" (2012) with a relative citation ratio of 8.0, "[Removal of sialic acid involving Klotho causes cell-surface retention of TRPV5 channel via binding to galectin-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18606998)" (2008) with a relative citation ratio of 7.71, and "[Differential expression of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in thyroid tumors. Potential diagnostic implications.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7677193)" (1995) with a relative citation ratio of 7.71. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[LGALS1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100097-LGALS1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the cytosol and is associated with Cluster 26 in blood expression, which includes monocytes and plasma membrane proteins. In tissue expression, it is part of Cluster 41, related to smooth muscle tissue and extracellular matrix organization. The gene is also found in various clusters in brain, cell line, and single cell expression, indicating non-specific and mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 6 experiments, [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 5 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 5 experiments, [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) with 5 experiments, and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 5 experiments.
