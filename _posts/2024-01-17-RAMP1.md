The gene is involved in [angiogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001525) and [calcium ion transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006816), and it enables [calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001635) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and is active on the [cell surface](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009986). Additionally, it is involved in various signaling pathways, including the [G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007186), the [adenylate cyclase-activating G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007189), and the [amylin receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097647). The gene also plays a role in [intracellular protein transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006886), [protein transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015031), [receptor internalization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031623), and [protein localization to plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0072659). Furthermore, it enables [coreceptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015026) and [amylin receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097643), and is part of the [receptor complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043235) and the [CGRP receptor complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990406). The gene also enables [calcitonin gene-related peptide binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990407) and is involved in the [calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990408). Lastly, it plays a role in the [positive regulation of protein glycosylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060050) and the [cellular response to hormone stimulus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032870).


The gene length is 77,595 base pairs (76.73% of all genes), the mature length is 2,964.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 45,565.5 base pairs.


The gene RAMP1 (NCBI ID: 10267) has been mentioned in [45 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RAMP1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1999 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2007 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning RAMP1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Sensitization of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors by receptor activity-modifying protein-1 in the trigeminal ganglion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17344407)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 4.76), "[A receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP)2-dependent adrenomedullin receptor is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor when coexpressed with human RAMP1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10342881)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 3.48), "[Receptor activity-modifying protein 1 determines the species selectivity of non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11847213)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 3.34), "[Post-endocytic sorting of calcitonin receptor-like receptor and receptor activity-modifying protein 1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17310067)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 1.43), and "[Identification of the human receptor activity-modifying protein 1 domains responsible for agonist binding specificity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12684503)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 1.28). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[RAMP1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000132329-RAMP1) is a receptor with evidence at the protein level, involved in FDA approved drug targets. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in the nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane. RAMP1 is expressed in NK-cells of unknown function, neuronal tissues involved in transcription, astrocytes with mixed functions, prostate cancer cell lines, and endometrial stromal cells involved in transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 4 experiments, [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 4 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 4 experiments, and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 4 experiments.
