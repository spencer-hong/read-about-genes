The gene length is 561,407 base pairs (98.71% of all genes), the mature length is 4,475 base pairs (87.41% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 540,213 base pairs (99.37% of all genes).


MEGF9 has an NCBI gene ID of 1955. The earliest publication mentioning MEGF9 was in 2007, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2017. There are [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MEGF9%22) publications related to MEGF9, according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). Note that the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top publications mentioning MEGF9 include "[miR-7/EGFR/MEGF9 axis regulates cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis via PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34629037)" (2021) with a relative citation ratio of 1.85, and "[MEGF9: a novel transmembrane protein with a strong and developmentally regulated expression in the nervous system.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16981854)" (2007) with a relative citation ratio of 0.35. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 6 experiments, [REST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5978) with 5 experiments, [NELFE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7936) with 5 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments, and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.257 (63.04th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -11.88 (19.6th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.004 (59.35th percentile), with a secondary structure composition of 24.09% helix (3.63rd percentile), 31.06% sheet (34.23rd percentile), and 36.21% turn (92.23rd percentile). The instability index is 47.30 (47.66th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.45 (16.96th percentile). The protein has a length of 602 amino acids (68.74th percentile) and a molecular weight of 62983.08 Da (65.49th percentile).
