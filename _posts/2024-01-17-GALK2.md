The gene enables [galactokinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004335) and [N-acetylgalactosamine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0033858), and is involved in [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524). It is located in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and is involved in various processes including [carbohydrate metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005975), [galactose metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006012), and [carbohydrate phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046835).


The gene length is 5,496 base pairs (15.36% of all genes), the mature length is 2,302 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 5,496 base pairs.


The gene GALK2 (NCBI ID: 2585) has been mentioned in [3 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GALK2%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2005, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2011.


The top 5 publications mentioning GALK2 include "[The molecular architecture of human N-acetylgalactosamine kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16006554)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 1.4), "[Mechanistic studies on human N-acetylgalactosamine kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19874134)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 0.36), and "[N-acetylgalactosamine kinase: a naturally promiscuous small molecule kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21984386)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 0.08). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GALK2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000156958-GALK2) is a gene encoding a protein with kinase and transferase molecular functions. It is involved in disease variants and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. GALK2 is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood (non-specific - cell proliferation), Cluster 55 for tissue (kidney & intestine - metabolism), Cluster 50 for brain (non-specific - nucleic acid binding), Cluster 58 for cell line (non-specific - nuclear processes), and Cluster 3 for single cell (basal prostatic cells - lipid metabolism).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [ARID2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/196528), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including metabolic disorders such as obesity and overnutrition, cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and vascular disease, and mental health conditions such as cognitive disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Additionally, specific conditions like Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and developmental disorders of mental health are also noted.



The gene is expressed in the adrenal gland and kidney according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in the heart, CD34+ cells, CD4+ T cells, leukemia chronic myelogenous K-562 cells, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, and the uterus corpus.



The mouse ortholog gene 69976, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 2585, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal lens, retina, and retina vasculature morphologies, as well as abnormal vitreous body morphology and cataract, all of which are observed in both sexes. Additionally, there is an increased circulating alkaline phosphatase level and persistence of the hyaloid vascular system, also observed in both sexes. Notably, an increased heart rate variability is observed, but this phenotype is not present in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.040174672489082894 (81.93rd percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -3.79946491565056 (37.1st percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.9987261904761905 (35.62nd percentile). The protein has a length of 458 amino acids (52.91st percentile) and a molecular weight of 50377.75480000005 Da (52.12nd percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 0.36899563318777295 for helix (84.78th percentile), 0.34934497816593885 for sheet (58.54th percentile), and 0.2685589519650655 for turn (36.7th percentile). The instability index is 50.11552401746726 (57.71st percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.190471076965332 (35.33rd percentile). These values were calculated using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
