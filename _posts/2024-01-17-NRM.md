The gene enables [molecular function](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003674) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [nuclear envelope](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005635), [nuclear inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005637), and [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). Additionally, it is active in and located in the [nuclear membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031965) and is involved in [biological process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008150).


The gene length is 22,240.0 base pairs (44.66% of all genes), the mature length is 1,045.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 21,240.5 base pairs.


The gene NRM (NCBI ID: 11270) has been mentioned in [3 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NRM%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1985, and the middle 50% of publications range from 1995 to 2008.


The top publications mentioning NRM include "[Analysis of the localization and topology of nurim, a polytopic protein tightly associated with the inner nuclear membrane.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15542857)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.22) and "[The integral nuclear membrane protein nurim plays a role in the suppression of apoptosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23092226)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 0.19). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Note that the citation count is from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[NRM](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137404-NRM) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily located in the nuclear membrane and is expressed in various clusters, including dendritic cells of unknown function, connective tissue involved in ECM organization, hindbrain with mixed function, RS4;11 cell line of unknown function, and late spermatids involved in spermatogenesis. The gene is unprognostic in several cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Colon Adenocarcinoma, Glioblastoma Multiforme, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Ovary Serous Cystadenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, Rectum Adenocarcinoma, Skin Cutaneous Melanoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma, and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and broader cardiovascular system diseases. Additionally, the data highlights links to various musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, such as bone inflammation disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bone disease, and general musculoskeletal system diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, the ovary, and leukemia lymphoblastic cells (MOLT-4).




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.549236641221375 (95.79th percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity. The charge at pH 7.0 is 3.112832472730954 (61.66th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.9785476190476191 (3.73rd percentile). The protein has a helix affinity of 0.4045801526717557 (94.12th percentile), a sheet affinity of 0.46946564885496184 (96.33rd percentile), and a turn affinity of 0.20610687022900762 (3.24th percentile). The instability index is 43.86526717557253 (35.21st percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.824384117126463 (74.48th percentile). The protein has a length of 262 amino acids (23.36th percentile) and a molecular weight of 29378.563200000055 Da (23.62nd percentile). These values were calculated using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
