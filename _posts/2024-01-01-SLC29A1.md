The gene length is 724.0 base pairs (0.9% of all genes), with a mature length of 724.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 724.0 base pairs.


The gene SLC29A1, with NCBI Gene ID 2030, has been the subject of [195 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLC29A1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink). The earliest publication year is 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning SLC29A1, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that investigate the gene's role in pancreatic cancer and nucleoside transport. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable publications include "[Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 levels predict response to gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18992248)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 8.79), "[The absence of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 is associated with reduced survival in patients with gemcitabine-treated pancreas adenocarcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15501974)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 7.08), and "[Pancreatic cancer hENT1 expression and survival from gemcitabine in patients from the ESPAC-3 trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24301456)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 6.91). Additionally, "[Kinetic and pharmacological properties of cloned human equilibrative nucleoside transporters, ENT1 and ENT2, stably expressed in nucleoside transporter-deficient PK15 cells. Ent2 exhibits a low affinity for guanosine and cytidine but a high affinity for inosine.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10722669)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 5.49) and "[ZIP4 Increases Expression of Transcription Factor ZEB1 to Promote Integrin α3β1 Signaling and Inhibit Expression of the Gemcitabine Transporter ENT1 in Pancreatic Cancer Cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31711924)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 4.9) are also significant.

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 6 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 5 experiments, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 5 experiments, [OTX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5015) with 5 experiments, and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The SLC29A1 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Diastolic blood pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230300) and [Systolic blood pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230300), both of which map to the MeSH term [Pressure](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011312) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, SLC29A1 is associated with [Heel bone mineral density](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30048462), which maps to the MeSH term [Minerals](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008903) through embedding match.


The mouse ortholog gene 63959, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 2030, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal eye morphology, decreased body length, decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, increased grip strength, increased mean corpuscular volume, and vertebral fusion, all of which are observed in both sexes. Additionally, abnormal rib morphology is noted, although this phenotype is not observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.687 (97.45th percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity. The protein's charge at pH 7 is 4.78 (67.32nd percentile), and its median structural flexibility is 0.980 (4.62nd percentile). The protein has a notable affinity for sheet structures (0.458, 95.33rd percentile) and a moderate affinity for helix structures (0.342, 69.45th percentile). The instability index is 37.47 (15.26th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.62 (69.16th percentile). The protein's length is 456 amino acids (52.68th percentile), with a molecular weight of 50218.85 Da (51.92nd percentile).
