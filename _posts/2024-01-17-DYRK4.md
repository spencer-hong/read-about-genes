The gene length is 20,557 base pairs (42.72% of all genes), the mature length is 1,516 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 16,050 base pairs.


The gene DYRK4, with NCBI ID 8798, has been mentioned in [1 publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DYRK4%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2021, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2021 to 2021.


The top publication mentioning DYRK4 is "[A Novel Neoplastic Fusion Transcript, RAD51AP1-DYRK4, Confers Sensitivity to the MEK Inhibitor Trametinib in Aggressive Breast Cancers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33172895)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.28). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[DYRK4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000010219-DYRK4) is a kinase with serine/threonine-protein kinase, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase molecular functions. Evidence for this protein is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in testis, specifically in early spermatids during spermatogenesis. Subcellularly, DYRK4 is localized to vesicles. In blood, it is expressed in B-cells related to immunoglobulins, while in the brain, its expression is non-specific but related to nucleic acid binding. In cell lines, its expression is non-specific and related to transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ZNF366](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/167465) with 5 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 4 experiments, [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 3 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 3 experiments, and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in the pituitary gland, as well as in various testicular tissues, including the interstitial region, Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and germ cells. Additionally, expression is observed in bronchial epithelial cells and Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi) cells.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.513 (33.66th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature.
