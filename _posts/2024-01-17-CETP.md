The gene CETP (NCBI ID: 1071) has been mentioned in [1,054 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CETP%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1975, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2000 and 2014.


The top five publications mentioning CETP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8409761)" (1993) with a relative citation ratio of 20.1, "[Increased high-density lipoprotein levels caused by a common cholesteryl-ester transfer protein gene mutation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2215607)" (1990) with a relative citation ratio of 17.3, "[Cholesteryl ester transfer protein: a novel target for raising HDL and inhibiting atherosclerosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12588754)" (2003) with a relative citation ratio of 13.85, "[Effects of an inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein on HDL cholesterol.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15071125)" (2004) with a relative citation ratio of 12.76, and "[Increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with mutation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene despite increased HDL levels.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8675707)" (1996) with a relative citation ratio of 12.17. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CETP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000087237-CETP) is implicated in atherosclerosis and disease variants, with evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is associated with immune response in lymphoid tissue, mixed function in the hindbrain, hemostasis in leukemia cell lines, and mixed function in adipocytes and endothelial cells. It is also expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, although its function in this context is unknown.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), each shown to be regulating in 2 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as gastrointestinal system cancer, lung cancer, and esophageal cancer. Infectious diseases, particularly those caused by viral agents like human immunodeficiency virus, are also implicated. Metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, are prominent, along with cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and hypertension. Mental health conditions, including major depressive disorder, and musculoskeletal diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, are also linked. Additionally, the data highlights associations with eye diseases, specifically age-related macular degeneration, and various metabolic syndromes.


Genome-wide association studies have linked CETP to various traits and diseases. Notably, CETP has been associated with [Alkyldiacylglycerol (O-52:0) [NL-16:0] levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35668104), which maps to [Diglycerides](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004075) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, CETP is linked to [Apolipoprotein A1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484%20|%20pubmed_id:34226706) and [Apolipoprotein B levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), both mapping to [Apolipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001053).

CETP is also associated with [Exudative age-related macular degeneration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25629512), mapping to [Macular Degeneration](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008268), and various lipid and cholesterol levels, including [HDL cholesterol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24886709), mapping to [Cholesterol, HDL](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008076), and [Triglyceride levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), mapping to [Triglycerides](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D014280). These findings highlight the diverse roles of CETP in lipid metabolism and related diseases.


The gene is expressed in adipose tissue, breast, thyroid, and spleen according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), heart, liver, placenta, fetal liver, and lymph node.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to lipid metabolism and transport, including lipid digestion, mobilization, and transport, lipoprotein metabolism, HDL-mediated lipid transport, and LDL-mediated lipid transport. Additionally, they participate in broader metabolic processes, such as the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, as well as transmembrane transport of small molecules and orphan transporters.
