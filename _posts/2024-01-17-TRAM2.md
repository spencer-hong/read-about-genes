The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is involved in [SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, translocation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006616), [collagen biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032964), and [protein insertion into ER membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045048). It is located in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020).


The gene length is 186,305 base pairs (91.65% of all genes), the mature length is 3,684 base pairs (80.73% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 33,548 base pairs (65.6% of all genes).


The gene TRAM2 (NCBI ID: 9697) has been mentioned in [5 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TRAM2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2004, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2018 and 2022.


The top 5 publications mentioning TRAM2, ranked by their relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows:

[TRAM2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000065308-TRAM2) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the cytosol and is associated with connective tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization in various tissue expression clusters. In the brain, it is specifically expressed in the choroid plexus, with a notable role in mitochondria. TRAM2 is also expressed in connective tissue cells and plasma cells, where it is involved in ECM organization and protein processing, respectively. However, it is unprognostic for various cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRIM24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8805) with 7 experiments, [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 6 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) with 5 experiments, and [INTS13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55726) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent detection in CHIP-seq studies.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as cellular proliferation disorders. Respiratory system diseases, particularly those affecting the lower respiratory tract and lungs, are also implicated. Metabolic disorders, specifically those related to carbohydrate and glucose metabolism, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, are notable. Additionally, the data highlights mental health conditions such as cognitive disorders, bipolar disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Gastrointestinal system diseases and mouth diseases are also associated with the GWAS findings.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including cardiac myocytes, CD33+ myeloid cells, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, adipocytes, smooth muscle, and placenta. Additionally, it is expressed in the skin.



The mouse ortholog gene 170829, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 9697, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal joint, radius, scapula, ulna, and vertebral arch morphologies, as well as absent pinna reflex, decreased bone mineral content and density, increased circulating amylase levels, and kyphosis. Notably, abnormal joint morphology, absent pinna reflex, decreased bone mineral content and density, increased circulating amylase levels, and kyphosis are observed in both sexes, while abnormal radius, scapula, and ulna morphologies are not.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.184 (90.12th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 13.84 (87.69th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.980 (4.71st percentile). The protein has a high affinity for sheet structures (0.473, 96.61st percentile) and a moderate affinity for helix structures (0.327, 56.85th percentile). The instability index is 45.77 (42.06th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 9.32 (87.39th percentile). The protein sequence is 370 amino acids long (41.1th percentile) with a molecular weight of 43327.30 Da (43.82nd percentile).
