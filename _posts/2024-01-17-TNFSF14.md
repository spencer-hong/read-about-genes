[TNFSF14](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000125735-TNFSF14) is a cytokine with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in vesicles. The gene is expressed in neutrophils with unknown function (Cluster 21) and is associated with metabolism in the liver (Cluster 83). In the brain, it is found in the vasculature (Cluster 12), and in cell lines, it is linked to the immune response in lymphoma (Cluster 55). Single-cell expression analysis places it in NK-cells involved in the adaptive immune response (Cluster 19). The gene is unprognostic in various cancer types, including Breast Invasive Carcinoma, Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Colon Adenocarcinoma, Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Ovary Serous Cystadenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma, Testicular Germ Cell Tumor, and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) and [PAX5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5079), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) were each found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, mental health disorders, and specific developmental disorders. Notably, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and multiple sclerosis are highlighted as specific conditions within these broader categories.


The gene TNFSF14 has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Gamma glutamyl transferase levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), which maps to the MeSH term [Transferases](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D014166) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, it is associated with [Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594039), a direct synonym match for the MeSH term [gamma-Glutamyltransferase](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005723). Furthermore, TNFSF14 is linked to [Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067605), which maps to the MeSH term [Necrosis](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D009336) through embedding match.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, fallopian tube, and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in multiple immune cell types such as B lymphoblasts, CD33+ myeloid cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and whole blood.
