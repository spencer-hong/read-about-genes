The gene enables [inositol-1,4-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004441) and [inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate 1-phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0052829), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872). It is located in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and is involved in several processes, including the [phosphate-containing compound metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006796), [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165), and the [phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046854).


The gene length is 152,013 base pairs (89.09% of all genes), the mature length is 2,632 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 127,827 base pairs.


The gene INPP1 (NCBI ID: 3628) has been mentioned in [10 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22INPP1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2012.


The top five publications mentioning INPP1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Association study of the INPP1, 5HTT, BDNF, AP-2beta and GSK-3beta GENE variants and restrospectively scored response to lithium prophylaxis in bipolar disorder.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16787706)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 1.92), "[The polymorphic inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase gene as a candidate for pharmacogenetic prediction of lithium-responsive manic-depressive illness.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9682271)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 1.69), "[Genetic variability at IMPA2, INPP1 and GSK3Î² increases the risk of suicidal behavior in bipolar patients.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23453640)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.44), "[A novel mammalian lithium-sensitive enzyme with a dual enzymatic activity, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate phosphatase and inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10347153)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 1.28), and "[Association of INPP1, PIK3CG, and TSC2 gene variants with autistic disorder: implications for phosphatidylinositol signalling in autism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14627686)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 0.75). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[INPP1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000151689-INPP1) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the centriolar satellite and cytosol. INPP1 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 19 in eosinophils with unknown function, Cluster 21 in testis with unknown function, Cluster 11 in brain white matter involved in signal transduction, Cluster 2 in mucus-secreting cells with unknown function, and Cluster 11 in late spermatids with unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869), and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.



The input data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are noted. Neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, and cognitive disorders, are also represented. Furthermore, the data encompasses hematopoietic system diseases, immune system diseases, and cardiovascular system diseases.


The genome-wide association study has identified a significant association between the INPP1 gene and [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36224396).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the esophagus, vagina, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the hypothalamus and multiple testicular tissues, such as the interstitial tissue, Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and germ cells.


The input data highlights key pathways involved in metabolism, specifically focusing on inositol phosphate metabolism. Notably, it includes the synthesis of IP2, IP, and Ins in the cytosol.


The mouse ortholog gene 16329 and its human ortholog gene 3628 are associated with the phenotype of decreased body length, observed in both sexes.
