The gene is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654) and the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739), specifically within the [mitochondrial inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005743). It is part of the [TIM23 mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005744). The gene is involved in [protein targeting to mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006626), [intracellular protein transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006886), and [protein import into mitochondrial matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030150). Additionally, it contributes to [protein transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008320).


The gene length is 112,638 base pairs (84.07% of all genes), the mature length is 2,065 base pairs (54.45% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 96,405 base pairs (87.73% of all genes).


TIMM17A, with NCBI Gene ID 10440, has been mentioned in [29 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TIMM17A%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1996 and the middle 50% of publications ranging from 1999 to 2014. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning TIMM17A, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Mitochondrial presequence translocase: switching between TOM tethering and motor recruitment involves Tim21 and Tim17.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15797382)" (2005) (RCR: 4.98), "[A presequence- and voltage-sensitive channel of the mitochondrial preprotein translocase formed by Tim23.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11713477)" (2001) (RCR: 4.51), "[Stress-regulated translational attenuation adapts mitochondrial protein import through Tim17A degradation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24315374)" (2013) (RCR: 3.43), "[The preprotein translocase of the mitochondrial inner membrane: function and evolution.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9931253)" (1999) (RCR: 3.07), and "[Mitochondria. Cell cycle-dependent regulation of mitochondrial preprotein translocase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25378463)" (2014) (RCR: 2.6). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TIMM17A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134375-TIMM17A) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and mitochondria. The gene is part of Cluster 12 for blood expression, which is associated with non-specific mitochondrial translation, and Cluster 23 for tissue expression, linked to non-specific cellular respiration. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 23, which is associated with the choroid plexus and mixed function. Additionally, TIMM17A is part of Cluster 45 for cell line expression, related to non-specific nuclear processes, and Cluster 77 for single-cell expression, associated with plasma cells and protein processing.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [ZBTB33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10009) and [TCF12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6938) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of mental health diseases.


The gene TIMM17A has been associated with several traits through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Body mass index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36581621), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Body Mass Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015992) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, TIMM17A has been associated with [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36224396).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi), smooth muscle, and bronchial epithelial cells.


The input data highlights two key pathways: metabolism of proteins and mitochondrial protein import. These pathways are integral to cellular function, with the metabolism of proteins encompassing the synthesis, degradation, and modification of proteins, while mitochondrial protein import involves the transport of proteins into mitochondria for various cellular processes.
