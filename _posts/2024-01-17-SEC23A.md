[SEC23A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100934-SEC23A) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, known to have disease variants. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. The gene is associated with vesicular transport in blood, metabolism in liver tissue, mixed function in the brain's choroid plexus, gene expression regulation in cell lines, and muscle contraction in smooth muscle cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) and [TAF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various metabolic disorders, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, and glucose metabolism diseases. Specifically, there are strong links to diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, the data highlights associations with nervous system diseases, particularly central nervous system diseases and brain diseases, including epilepsy syndrome.


The gene SEC23A has been associated with [Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32059762) and [Vitamin D levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29343764) through genome-wide association studies. These traits were mapped to the closest existing MeSH terms using a method called [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0), with the closest matches being [25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015652) and [Vitamins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D014815), respectively.


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including pineal gland (night), cardiac myocytes, retina, adipocytes, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, colon, and small intestine. Additionally, it is expressed in blood vessels.


The input data highlights various pathways and diseases associated with glycosylation, protein processing, and immune system functions. Key pathways include antigen presentation involving class I MHC, COPII-mediated vesicle transport, ER to Golgi transport, and asparagine N-linked glycosylation. Several diseases linked to defective glycosylation enzymes are noted, such as ALG2-CDG, ALG3-CDG, ALG6-CDG, ALG8-CDG, ALG9-CDG, DPAGT1-CDG, MRT15, MGAT2-CDG, MOGS-CDG, MPDU1-CDG, ALG1-CDG, ALG12-CDG, ALG11-CDG, ALG14-CMS, and RFT1-CDG. Additionally, the data covers broader categories like diseases associated with N-glycosylation, post-translational protein modification, metabolism of proteins, and immune system functions.
