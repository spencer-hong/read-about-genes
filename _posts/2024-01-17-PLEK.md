[PLEK](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000115956-PLEK) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the nucleoli and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 10 for blood expression related to non-specific membrane trafficking, Cluster 77 for tissue expression in bone marrow related to cell proliferation, Cluster 12 for brain expression related to vasculature, Cluster 55 for cell line expression in lymphoma related to immune response, and Cluster 29 for single cell expression in monocytes related to innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [STAT5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6777), and [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1051) and [IKZF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10320) were found to be regulating in 3 experiments each.

These findings highlight the role of PLEK in various aspects of hematopoiesis and blood cell regulation.


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung, blood, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in various cell types and tissues such as Lymphoma (Burkitt's, Raji), BDCA4+ Dendritic Cells, CD56+ NK Cells, CD14+ Monocytes, Leukemia (promyelocytic-HL-60), and Bone marrow.


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in hemostasis, including platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, platelet degranulation, and the response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca2+. These pathways are crucial for the regulation of blood clotting and the maintenance of vascular integrity.
