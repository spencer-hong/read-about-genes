The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005546). It is located in the [cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005856) and is part of a [protein-containing complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032991). The gene is active in and located in the [dendritic spine](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043197), where it is involved in the [positive regulation of synapse structural plasticity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051835).


The gene length is 70,598 base pairs (74.71% of all genes), the mature length is 3,202 base pairs (75.24% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 70,580 base pairs (82.6% of all genes).


The gene FRMPD4 (NCBI ID: 9758) has been mentioned in [6 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FRMPD4%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2008, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning FRMPD4, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include: ["Preso regulates NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity via modulating nitric oxide and calcium responses after traumatic brain injury."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31235685) (2019) (relative citation ratio: 1.51), ["Preso, a novel PSD-95-interacting FERM and PDZ domain protein that regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19118189) (2008) (relative citation ratio: 0.66), ["FRMPD4 mutations cause X-linked intellectual disability and disrupt dendritic spine morphogenesis."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29267967) (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.57), ["Preso regulation of dendritic outgrowth through PI(4,5)P2-dependent PDZ interaction with Î²Pix."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22595022) (2012) (relative citation ratio: 0.32), and ["Structural basis for the recognition of the scaffold protein Frmpd4/Preso1 by the TPR domain of the adaptor protein LGN."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25664792) (2015) (relative citation ratio: 0.24). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[FRMPD4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000169933-FRMPD4) is a gene implicated in intellectual disability, with evidence supporting its involvement at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in some tissues, and it is notably expressed in the brain, specifically in neuronal signaling pathways. In the brain, FRMPD4 is associated with astrocyte-neuron interactions, and its expression is also observed in rhabdoid cell lines, particularly in membrane components. Additionally, single-cell expression data indicates its involvement in neuronal signaling.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) and [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), and [LMNB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4001) were each found to be regulating in 2 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as those caused by viral agents, specifically human immunodeficiency virus infectious disease. Additionally, the data highlights various types of cancer, including lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, as well as kidney and urinary system diseases. Notably, there are strong associations with nervous system diseases, particularly neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, and Parkinson's disease. Mental health disorders, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and mood disorders, are also implicated. Furthermore, the data points to motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.



The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, brain, and colon, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in various brain regions such as the Prefrontal Cortex, Cingulate Cortex, Subthalamic Nucleus, Parietal Lobe, Occipital Lobe, Pons, and Globus Pallidus.
