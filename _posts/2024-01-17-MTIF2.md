The gene MTIF2 (NCBI ID: 4528) has been mentioned in [3 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MTIF2%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1995, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2001 and 2014.


The top publications mentioning MTIF2 include "[Cloning and sequence analysis of the human mitochondrial translational initiation factor 2 cDNA.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7829522)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 0.9), "[MTIF2 impairs 5 fluorouracil-mediated immunogenic cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo: Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic significance.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33129983)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.58), and "[Overexpression and purification of mammalian mitochondrial translational initiation factor 2 and initiation factor 3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17913635)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 0.36). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MTIF2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000085760-MTIF2) is a mitochondrial initiation factor with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the mitochondria. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 25 in blood, Cluster 35 in tissues, Cluster 28 in the brain, Cluster 26 in cell lines, and Cluster 68 in single cells, indicating its involvement in muscle contraction and mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), [ARNT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/405), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various hematopoietic and immune-related cell types, including Lymphoma Burkitt's (Raji and Daudi), CD34+ cells, Leukemia (chronic myelogenous K-562 and promyelocytic HL-60), as well as in bronchial epithelial cells. Additionally, the gene is expressed in colon tissue.


The input data highlights several key biological processes, including organelle biogenesis and maintenance, mitochondrial translation, and mitochondrial translation initiation. These processes are essential for the proper functioning and regulation of cellular organelles, particularly mitochondria.
