[GPC4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000076716-GPC4) is implicated in various diseases, including deafness, disease variants, and intellectual disability, with evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized to the nucleoplasm and plasma membrane. It is notably expressed in choroid plexus tissue, involved in transmembrane transport, and in astrocytes within the brain. Additionally, GPC4 is expressed in rhabdoid cell lines and alveolar cells, contributing to lung function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) with 7 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 5 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 5 experiments, [SMAD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4087) with 5 experiments, and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as cognitive disorders and diseases of mental health. Specific conditions mentioned include anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorder, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Additionally, the data encompasses developmental disorders of mental health and specific developmental disorders.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, placenta, colon, small intestine, pituitary, skeletal muscle, and fetal lung. Additionally, it is expressed in blood vessels.


The input data includes various pathways and diseases related to carbohydrate metabolism, glycosaminoglycan metabolism, and glycosylation. Notable conditions include Myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora, Glycogen storage diseases, and several types of Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), such as Sly syndrome, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, and various forms of Sanfilippo syndrome. Additionally, the data covers defects in specific genes like B3GAT3, B4GALT1, and CHST14, which are associated with conditions like JDSSDHD, B4GALT1-CDG (CDG-2d), and EDS, musculocontractural type, respectively. The data also includes pathways related to visual transduction, retinoid metabolism, and signal transduction.


The mouse ortholog gene 14735 and its human ortholog gene 2239 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal snout morphology, decreased fasting circulating glucose level, increased circulating bilirubin level, and increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Notably, these phenotypes are observed in both sexes.
