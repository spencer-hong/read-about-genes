The gene length is 7,057 base pairs (19.09% of all genes), the mature length is 1,021 base pairs (23.26% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 4,178.5 base pairs (15.61% of all genes).


The gene TSPAN6, with NCBI ID 7105, has been featured in [7 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TSPAN6%22) (count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2017 and 2021.


The top 5 publications mentioning TSPAN6, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include "[Tetraspanin-6 negatively regulates exosome production.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32108028)" (2020) with an RCR of 3.43, "[Tetraspanin 6 is a regulator of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34521767)" (2021) with an RCR of 1.47, "[TSPAN6 is a suppressor of Ras-driven cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184157)" (2022) with an RCR of 0.65, "[Tetraspanin 6: A novel regulator of hippocampal synaptic transmission and long term plasticity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28207852)" (2017) with an RCR of 0.4, and "[Correction: Tetraspanin 6: A novel regulator of hippocampal synaptic transmission and long term plasticity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29065158)" (2017) with an RCR of 0.11. The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), and [SS18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6760), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.





The gene TSPAN6 has been associated with [thyroid stimulating hormone levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37872160), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Hormones](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006728) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.359 (93.08th percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity.
