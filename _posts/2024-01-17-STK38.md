[STK38](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000112079-STK38) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, functioning as a kinase. Evidence supports its existence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the cytosol. STK38 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 35 in neutrophils related to protein binding, Cluster 75 in epithelium associated with extracellular exosomes, Cluster 25 in non-specific brain tissue related to transcription, Cluster 6 in leukemia cell lines involved in signal transduction, and Cluster 7 in T-cells related to T-cell receptor function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), and [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as those caused by viral agents, specifically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectious disease. Additionally, the data highlights metabolic disorders, particularly acquired metabolic diseases related to carbohydrate and glucose metabolism, with a specific focus on diabetes mellitus, notably type 2 diabetes mellitus.


The gene STK38 has been associated with [Mean platelet volume](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34226706), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Mean Platelet Volume](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D063847) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including nerve and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in multiple immune cell types, such as CD33+ Myeloid cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ Monocytes, and Whole Blood.
