The gene length is 72,791 base pairs (75.43% of all genes), the mature length is 2,741 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 51,121 base pairs.


The gene RAP1B (NCBI ID: 5908) has been mentioned in [90 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RAP1B%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1988 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1998 and 2017. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning RAP1B, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Glucocorticoids mediate induction of microRNA-708 to suppress ovarian cancer metastasis through targeting Rap1B.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25569036)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 3.07), "[Structure of Epac2 in complex with a cyclic AMP analogue and RAP1B.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18660803)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 2.98), "[Association of Rap1a and Rap1b proteins with late endocytic/phagocytic compartments and Rap2a with the Golgi complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7962206)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 2.74), "[Structure of Rap1b bound to talin reveals a pathway for triggering integrin activation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29170462)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 2.59), and "[Nucleotide sequence of a human cDNA encoding a ras-related protein (rap1B).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3137530)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 2.54). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RAP1B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000127314-RAP1B) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function. It is implicated in disease variants and has evidence at the protein level. The RNA expression of RAP1B is detected in all tissues. In terms of expression clusters, it is associated with Cluster 28 in neutrophils with unknown function, Cluster 77 in bone marrow related to cell proliferation, Cluster 55 in the brain with non-specific transcription, Cluster 5 in rhabdoid cell lines with unknown function, and Cluster 57 in platelets related to hemostasis.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624), and [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942) and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.


The transcription factor [8861](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861) was found to be regulating genes in 2 experiments according to Perturb-seq data from the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).


The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including cognitive disorders, diseases of mental health, mood disorders, substance-related disorders, mental depression, substance abuse, and antidepressant type abuse.



The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including adipose tissue, breast, blood vessel, and lung. Additionally, it is expressed in various immune cell types such as CD34+ cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and whole blood.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to the adaptive immune system, immune system, and signal transduction. Specifically, they participate in Rap1 signaling, GRB2:SOS linkage to MAPK signaling for integrins, p130Cas linkage to MAPK signaling for integrins, and integrin alphaIIb beta3 signaling. Additionally, these proteins play roles in platelet aggregation (plug formation), hemostasis, and platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation.
