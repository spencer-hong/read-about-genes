The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [cell morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000902), [mesoderm formation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001707), [gamete generation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007276), and [axon guidance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007411). It plays a role in axis specification, such as [anterior/posterior axis specification](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009948) and [dorsal/ventral axis specification](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009950), and is involved in [gene expression](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010467) and its [positive regulation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010628). The gene enables molecular functions like [frizzled binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005109), [cytokine activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005125), and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in various cellular components, including the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), [endoplasmic reticulum lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005788), [Golgi lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005796), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). Additionally, the gene is part of the [Wnt signalosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990909) and is active in the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615).

[WNT3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000108379-WNT3) is a developmental protein that functions as a proto-oncogene. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized in vesicles. It is expressed in skin tissue related to cornification (Cluster 13), sub-cortical brain regions with mixed function (Cluster 38), neuronal cell lines involved in signal transduction (Cluster 72), and late spermatids with unknown function (Cluster 11).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer.

Cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart disease, and myocardial infarction, are also noted. Neurological disorders, such as neurodegenerative disease and Parkinson's disease, are part of the dataset. Furthermore, hematological conditions like anemia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis are included, along with autoimmune diseases like celiac disease and hypersensitivity reactions.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the prefrontal cortex, cardiac myocytes, heart, liver, CD34+ cells, CD33+ myeloid cells, and lymphoma Burkitt's (Raji and Daudi) cells.


The input data highlights various pathways and processes involving WNT signaling, including enhanced WNT signaling and proliferation in RNF mutants, TCF-dependent signaling in response to WNT, and the stabilization of AXIN by XAV939 through tankyrase inhibition. Additionally, misspliced LRP5 mutants exhibit enhanced beta-catenin-dependent signaling. The data also covers broader categories such as signaling by WNT in cancer, general WNT signaling, and WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking. Other notable pathways include GPCR ligand binding, signal transduction, and metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes. Furthermore, the data mentions the role of defective ACTH in causing obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (POMCD), as well as the abrogation of WNT ligand secretion by the PORCN inhibitor LGK974.


The mouse ortholog gene 22415 and its human ortholog gene 7473 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.
