Additionally, it is involved in the [tetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046900).


The gene length is 30,588 base pairs (53.25% of all genes), the mature length is 3,604.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 29,226.5 base pairs.


The gene GGH (NCBI ID: 8836) has been mentioned in [1,476 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GGH%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning GGH is 1966, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1992 and 2010.


The top five publications mentioning GGH, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Metallothionein-human GH fusion genes stimulate growth of mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6356363)" (1983) (relative citation ratio: 12.08), "[Growth hormone (GH)-releasing peptide stimulates GH release in normal men and acts synergistically with GH-releasing hormone.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2108187)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 10.97), "[Altered Gs and adenylate cyclase activity in human GH-secreting pituitary adenomas.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2825031)" (1987) (relative citation ratio: 10.8), "[The physiology of growth hormones (GHs) in pregnant women and partial characterization of the placental GH variant.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3372680)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 10.13), and "[A meta-analysis of the effect of lowering serum levels of GH and IGF-I on mortality in acromegaly.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18524797)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 9.93). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GGH](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137563-GGH) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles. Its expression is notable in various clusters, including Cluster 13 for non-specific mitochondria in blood, Cluster 1 for liver and kidney metabolism in tissues, Cluster 24 for neurons with mixed function in the brain, Cluster 32 for non-specific cell proliferation in cell lines, and Cluster 24 for cytotrophoblasts with mitochondria in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including cancer, diseases of cellular proliferation, metabolic diseases, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, glucose metabolism diseases, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular system diseases, and general diseases of anatomical entities.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including liver and colon, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, Leukemia promyelocytic-HL-60 cells, CD105+ endothelial cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, pancreas, colon, and fetal liver.



The mouse ortholog gene 14590 and its human ortholog 8836 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit enlarged lymph nodes and enlarged urinary bladder. Additionally, a small uterus is observed, although this phenotype is not present in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.092 (78.72 percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -0.925 (47.03 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.995 (20.93 percentile). The protein has a predicted affinity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 33.33% (62.24 percentile), 40.25% (87.0 percentile), and 27.67% (44.35 percentile), respectively. The instability index is 36.68 (13.51 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.66 (45.63 percentile). The sequence length is 318 amino acids (32.57 percentile), with a molecular weight of 35963.94 Da (33.51 percentile).
