The gene length is 1,851,181.0 base pairs (99.95% of all genes), the mature length is 7,807.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 1,750,382.5 base pairs (99.99% of all genes).


The gene KCNQ4, with NCBI ID 9132, has been the subject of [78 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22KCNQ4%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2006 and 2019.


The top five publications mentioning KCNQ4, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[KCNQ4, a novel potassium channel expressed in sensory outer hair cells, is mutated in dominant deafness.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10025409)" (1999) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 14.19, "[Structural Basis for the Modulation of Human KCNQ4 by Small-Molecule Drugs.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33238160)" (2021) with an RCR of 5.33, "[Mice with altered KCNQ4 K+ channels implicate sensory outer hair cells in human progressive deafness.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16437162)" (2006) with an RCR of 4.31, "[AudioGene: refining the natural history of KCNQ4, GSDME, WFS1, and COCH-associated hearing loss.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038006)" (2022) with an RCR of 2.35, and "[Novel KCNQ4 variants in different functional domains confer genotype- and mechanism-based therapeutics in patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34316018)" (2021) with an RCR of 2.19. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [KCNQ4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000183873-KCNQ4) functions as an ion channel, specifically a voltage-gated potassium channel. It is implicated in deafness and non-syndromic deafness, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in many tissues and is notably expressed in smooth muscle tissue involved in ECM organization, choroid plexus with mixed function, and neurons with synaptic function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 5 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments, [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) with 4 experiments, and [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent detection in multiple experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.148 (74.1% percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 24.7 at pH 7.0 (95.64% percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.997 (28.04% percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 29.1% helix (24.02% percentile), 35.7% sheet (64.14% percentile), and 28.9% turn (55.26% percentile). The instability index is 49.4 (55.14% percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.6 (92.48% percentile). The protein has a length of 695 amino acids (75.03% percentile) and a molecular weight of 77099.8 Da (74.74% percentile).
