The gene length is 487.0 base pairs (0.42 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 487.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 487.0 base pairs.


The gene PNN has an NCBI Gene ID of 5411. It has been featured in [76 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PNN%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1984, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning PNN, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[RNA-Seq Profiling of Serum Exosomal Circular RNAs Reveals Circ-PNN as a Potential Biomarker for Human Colorectal Cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32626660)" (2020) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 4.58, "[Long-term biological and behavioural impact of an adolescent sexual health intervention in Tanzania: follow-up survey of the community-based MEMA kwa Vijana Trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20543994)" (2010) with an RCR of 3.54, "[Efficient and selective hydrogenation of amides to alcohols and amines using a well-defined manganese-PNN pincer complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30155202)" (2017) with an RCR of 3.45, "[LncRNA AATBC regulates Pinin to promote metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32364663)" (2020) with an RCR of 3.1, and "[Otx2-PNN Interaction to Regulate Cortical Plasticity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26881132)" (2016) with an RCR of 2.7. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), each with 6 experiments. Following closely are [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) and [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [INTS11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54973) was found to be regulating in 4 experiments.


The transcription factor [NFKB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6432) was found to be regulating genes in one Perturb-seq experiment, according to data from GTRD's database of transcription factor binding sites and the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).





The mouse gene with NCBI ID 18949 and its human ortholog with NCBI ID 5411 are associated with several phenotypes, including embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, embryonic lethality prior to tooth bud stage, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. Notably, the preweaning lethality phenotype is observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -1.414 (0.82 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -1.285 (45.58 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.030 (99.37 percentile). The protein has a high instability index of 98.671 (99.55 percentile) and an isoelectric point of 6.711 (46.45 percentile). The sequence length is 717 amino acids (76.37 percentile) with a molecular weight of 81626.78 Da (77.12 percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 35.43% for helix (77.4 percentile), 19.53% for sheet (1.81 percentile), and 31.10% for turn (71.23 percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, which can be referenced [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
