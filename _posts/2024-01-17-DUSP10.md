[DUSP10](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000143507-DUSP10) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase and protein phosphatase molecular functions. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and the protein is localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. DUSP10 is part of blood expression cluster 33, which is non-specific and involved in ATP binding, and tissue expression cluster 19, which is non-specific and involved in basic cellular processes. In the brain, it is part of expression cluster 11, associated with white matter and signal transduction. In cell lines, it is part of cluster 16, related to thyroid cancer and neuronal signaling. At the single-cell level, it is part of cluster 78, associated with NK-cells, T-cells, the immune system, and transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024), and [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), each with 5 experiments.
