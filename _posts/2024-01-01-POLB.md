The gene length is 467.0 base pairs (0.37 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 467.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 467.0 base pairs.


The gene POLB, with NCBI ID 5423, has been featured in [466 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLB%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1977, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2012.


The top five publications mentioning POLB, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Requirement of mammalian DNA polymerase-beta in base-excision repair.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8538772)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 15.05), "[Reconstitution of DNA base excision-repair with purified human proteins: interaction between DNA polymerase beta and the XRCC1 protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8978692)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 13.46), "[Excision of deoxyribose phosphate residues by DNA polymerase beta during DNA repair.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7624801)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 12.66), "[XRCC1 polypeptide interacts with DNA polymerase beta and possibly poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, and DNA ligase III is a novel molecular 'nick-sensor' in vitro.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8948628)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 11.24), and "[Crystal structures of human DNA polymerase beta complexed with gapped and nicked DNA: evidence for an induced fit mechanism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9287163)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 10.95). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829), [BCL3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/602), and [ZNF143](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7702), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The genome-wide association study has identified a link between the POLB gene and [Plasma parathyroid hormone levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30134803), with the closest MeSH match being [Hormones](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006728). This association was determined using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The mouse ortholog gene 18970 and its human ortholog gene 5423 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.6498507462686568 (21.11th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 7.31173309826444 at pH 7 (75.19th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.0073273809523808 (72.68th percentile).
