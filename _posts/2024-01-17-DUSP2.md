The gene is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654) and the [nuclear membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031965).


The gene length is 103,070 base pairs (82.35th percentile), the mature length is 1,721 base pairs (44.86th percentile), and the primary transcript length is 99,923 base pairs (88.23rd percentile).


DUSP2 (Gene ID: 1844) has been mentioned in [65 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DUSP2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1993 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2004 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning DUSP2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases PAC1, MKP-1, and MKP-2 have unique substrate specificities and reduced activity in vivo toward the ERK2 sevenmaker mutation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8626452)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 7.01), "[Control of MAP kinase activation by the mitogen-induced threonine/tyrosine phosphatase PAC1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8107850)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 5.74), "[PAC-1: a mitogen-induced nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7681221)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 4.84), "[Positive regulation of immune cell function and inflammatory responses by phosphatase PAC-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16474395)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 3.6), and "[The role of the lissencephaly protein Pac1 during nuclear migration in budding yeast.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12566428)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 3.08). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[DUSP2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000158050-DUSP2) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase and protein phosphatase molecular functions. Evidence for this gene is established at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane. DUSP2 is associated with NK-cells of unknown function in blood expression clusters and with cell proliferation in bone marrow tissue expression clusters. In the brain, it is linked to mixed functions in the forebrain, while in cell lines, it is associated with immune response in lymphoma. Single-cell expression data indicates its involvement in the immune system and transcription in NK-cells and T-cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), and [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the bladder, blood, and spleen. Additionally, it is expressed in several immune cell types such as B lymphoblasts, dendritic cells, NK cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells, as well as in certain cancer cell lines like Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji) and promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60).




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.011 (84.48th percentile), indicating a slightly hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 3.04 at pH 7.0 (61.45th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.993 (15.26th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 32.2% helix (51.84th percentile), 33.1% sheet (46.18th percentile), and 27.4% turn (41.68th percentile). The instability index is 59.4 (81.87th percentile), suggesting potential instability. The isoelectric point is 8.24 (61.86th percentile), with a molecular weight of 34399.27 Da (29.91st percentile). The sequence length is 314 amino acids (31.55th percentile).
