The gene is located in the [Golgi membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000139) and the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and is active in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). It is also found in the [perinuclear region of cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048471). The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [L-serine transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015194). It is involved in the [L-serine biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006564), [L-serine transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015825), [detection of virus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009597), [innate immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045087), [defense response to virus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051607), and [positive regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902237).


The gene length is 28,989 base pairs (51.79% of all genes), the mature length is 713 base pairs (9.83% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 12,798 base pairs (39.86% of all genes).


The gene SERINC3, with NCBI ID 10955, has been mentioned in [19 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SERINC3%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1946, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning SERINC3, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include: ["SERINC3 and SERINC5 restrict HIV-1 infectivity and are counteracted by Nef."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26416733) (2015) (relative citation ratio: 10.4), ["S2 from equine infectious anemia virus is an infectivity factor which counteracts the retroviral inhibitors SERINC5 and SERINC3."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27803322) (2016) (relative citation ratio: 2.49), ["Promoter hypermethylation of TMS1, BRCA1, ERalpha and PRB in serum and tumor DNA of invasive ductal breast carcinoma patients."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17599361) (2007) (relative citation ratio: 1.95), ["Variation in HIV-1 Nef function within and among viral subtypes reveals genetically separable antagonism of SERINC3 and SERINC5."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925973) (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.36), and ["DNA hypermethylation of cell cycle (p15 and p16) and apoptotic (p14, p53, DAPK and TMS1) genes in peripheral blood of leukemia patients."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24528084) (2014) (relative citation ratio: 1.21). The relative citation ratio measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SERINC3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000132824-SERINC3) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in testis related to spermatogenesis, neurons involved in synaptic function, and neutrophils associated with protein binding. In single-cell expression analysis, it is found in late spermatids, although its function in this context is unknown. The gene is also detected in various cell lines, but its expression is non-specific and related to plasma proteins.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [STAT5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6777), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [GATAD2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57459) was found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various metabolic disorders, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, glucose metabolism diseases, diabetes mellitus, and specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, whole brain, medulla oblongata, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, placenta, pituitary, and adrenal gland.



The mouse ortholog gene 26943 and its human ortholog gene 10955 are associated with phenotypes including decreased bone mineral density and decreased circulating magnesium level, with these effects observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.453 (94.44th percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity.
