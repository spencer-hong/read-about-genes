The gene TIMP2 (NCBI ID: 7077) has been mentioned in [648 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TIMP2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning TIMP2 is 1989, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2002 and 2017.


The top five publications mentioning TIMP2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-2). A new member of the metalloproteinase inhibitor family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2793861)" (1989) (relative citation ratio: 21.49), "[Human 72-kilodalton type IV collagenase forms a complex with a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases designated TIMP-2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2554304)" (1989) (relative citation ratio: 17.06), "[Urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 as early biomarkers of acute kidney injury and renal recovery following cardiac surgery.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24675717)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 11.69), "[The soluble catalytic domain of membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase cleaves the propeptide of progelatinase A and initiates autoproteolytic activation. Regulation by TIMP-2 and TIMP-3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8663332)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 11.66), and "[Stromal expression of 72 kda type IV collagenase (MMP-2) and TIMP-2 mRNAs in colorectal neoplasia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1323219)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 9.19). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[TIMP2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000035862-TIMP2) is a gene with molecular functions as a metalloenzyme inhibitor, metalloprotease inhibitor, and protease inhibitor. It is involved in cancer-related genes and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is associated with connective tissue and ECM organization in tissue expression clusters. In blood expression clusters, it is linked to non-specific innate immune responses. Additionally, TIMP2 is expressed in fibroblasts related to ECM organization in single-cell expression clusters.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), each with 5 experiments, followed by [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980) with 5 experiments, and [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each with 4 experiments.



The input data highlights a diverse range of disease conditions associated with various biological systems. These include several types of cancer, such as lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, as well as metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, are also represented. Neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, are noted, along with connective tissue diseases and musculoskeletal system disorders. Additionally, the data includes gastrointestinal system diseases, periodontal diseases, and specific conditions like plantar fascial fibromatosis.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood vessels and ovaries, according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in CD33+ myeloid cells, CD14+ monocytes, whole blood, adipocytes, smooth muscle, lung, and placenta.


The proteins are involved in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases, the degradation of the extracellular matrix, and extracellular matrix organization.


The mouse ortholog gene 21858 and its human ortholog 7077 are associated with phenotypes including abnormal startle reflex and single kidney, with these traits observed in both sexes.
