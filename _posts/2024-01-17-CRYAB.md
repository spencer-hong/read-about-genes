[CRYAB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000109846-CRYAB) is a gene with molecular functions as a chaperone and eye lens protein. It is involved in various diseases, including cancer-related genes, cardiomyopathy, cataract, disease variants, and myofibrillar myopathy. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in the plasma membrane and cytosol. It is highly expressed in heart muscle, contributing to cardiac muscle contraction, and in oligodendrocytes within the brain. Additionally, CRYAB is expressed in connective tissue cells, proximal tubular cells, and is involved in ECM organization and transmembrane transport.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), and [MED12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including several types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are noted. Other significant associations include hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, and cardiovascular system disease, specifically heart conduction disease.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, muscle, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, spinal cord, and olfactory bulb.
