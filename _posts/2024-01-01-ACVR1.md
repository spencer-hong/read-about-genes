The gene length is 558,762.0 base pairs (98.68% of all genes), the mature length is 1,687.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 532,346.5 base pairs.


The gene ACVR1, with NCBI ID 90, has been the subject of [151 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ACVR1%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1987, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2020.


The top five publications mentioning ACVR1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A recurrent mutation in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 causes inherited and sporadic fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16642017)" (2006) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 17.36, "[Genomic analysis of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas identifies three molecular subgroups and recurrent activating ACVR1 mutations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24705254)" (2014) with an RCR of 12.64, "[Recurrent activating ACVR1 mutations in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24705252)" (2014) with an RCR of 9.9, "[Recurrent somatic mutations in ACVR1 in pediatric midline high-grade astrocytoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24705250)" (2014) with an RCR of 8.5, and "[Neofunction of ACVR1 in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26621707)" (2015) with an RCR of 6.1. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) with 7 experiments, [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341) with 5 experiments, [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) with 5 experiments, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) with 5 experiments, and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 11477, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 90, is associated with several phenotypic outcomes. These include embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis and prior to the tooth bud stage, both specific to one sex. Additionally, the gene is linked to increased circulating total protein levels and complete penetrance preweaning lethality, both observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.18015717092337935 (71.22nd percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 0.4008811927190763 (51.61st percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.9979047619047619 (31.83rd percentile). The protein has a length of 509 amino acids (59.4th percentile) and a molecular weight of 57152.2619000001 Da (59.75th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 0.2829076620825147 for helix (18.82nd percentile), 0.3732809430255403 for sheet (74.95th percentile), and 0.2868369351669941 for turn (53.29th percentile). The instability index is 44.40591355599218 (37.17th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 7.117571830749512 (51.64th percentile). These values were calculated using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
