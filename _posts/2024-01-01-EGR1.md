The gene length is 814,496 base pairs (99.36% of all genes), the mature length is 3,669 base pairs (80.54% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 813,720 base pairs (99.8% of all genes).


EGR1 has an NCBI gene ID of 1958. The earliest publication mentioning EGR1 dates back to 1989, with the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2003 and 2017. There are [1,027 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22EGR1%22) related to EGR1, although the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727).


The top five publications mentioning EGR1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Immediate Early Genes, Memory and Psychiatric Disorders: Focus on c-Fos, Egr1 and Arc.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29755331)" (2018) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 10.11, "[Binding of the Wilms' tumor locus zinc finger protein to the EGR-1 consensus sequence.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2244209)" (1990) with an RCR of 9.87, "[The Role of the Transcription Factor EGR1 in Cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33842351)" (2021) with an RCR of 9.43, "[Regulation of life and death by the zinc finger transcription factor Egr-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12384981)" (2002) with an RCR of 9.19, and "[Lipopolysaccharide induction of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter in human monocytic cells. Regulation by Egr-1, c-Jun, and NF-kappaB transcription factors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9211933)" (1997) with an RCR of 8.4. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), and [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.








The mouse ortholog gene 13653, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 1958, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal embryo size, abnormal forebrain, hindbrain, and midbrain development, abnormal neural tube closure, abnormal optic disk morphology, embryonic growth retardation, and preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance, all of which affect both sexes. Additionally, the gene is linked to absent seminal vesicle, female infertility, male infertility, and small uterus, which are sex-specific phenotypes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.535 (31.42 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 4.42 at pH 7.0 (66.02 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.011 (84.5 percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 22.65% helix (2.21 percentile), 27.81% sheet (17.7 percentile), and 42.91% turn (98.65 percentile). The instability index is 75.69 (97.13 percentile), suggesting high instability. The isoelectric point is 8.51 (66.77 percentile), with a molecular weight of 57506.15 Da (60.15 percentile) and a length of 543 amino acids (63.43 percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
