The gene length is 6,657 base pairs (18.2% of all genes), the mature length is 863 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 4,754 base pairs.


The gene KRT1 (NCBI ID: 3848) has been mentioned in [114 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22KRT1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1992 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2002 and 2017. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning KRT1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Vitamin K: Double Bonds beyond Coagulation Insights into Differences between Vitamin K1 and K2 in Health and Disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30791399)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 8.86), "[Vitamins K1 and K2: The Emerging Group of Vitamins Required for Human Health.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698808)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 4.23), "[Identification of cytokeratin 1 as a binding protein and presentation receptor for kininogens on endothelial cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9520414)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 3.64), "[Keratin 1 maintains skin integrity and participates in an inflammatory network in skin through interleukin-18.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23132931)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 3.4), and "[A mutation in the V1 end domain of keratin 1 in non-epidermolytic palmar-plantar keratoderma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7528239)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 2.96). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[KRT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000167768-KRT1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, implicated in diseases such as Ichthyosis and Palmoplantar keratoderma. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in skin, contributing to cornification processes. In blood, KRT1 is expressed in T-cells, though its function in this context is unknown. The gene is also highly expressed in squamous epithelial cells, playing a role in keratinization. Despite its involvement in various tissues and cell types, KRT1 has been found to be unprognostic in several cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 2 experiments, followed by [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), [NCOA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8648), [GATA3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2625), and [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), each with 1 experiment.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, disease of mental health, substance-related disorder, substance dependence, and alcohol dependence.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the cervix uteri, vagina, and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD71+ early erythroid cells, bone marrow, fetal liver, appendix, skin, tongue, and thymus, suggesting that the gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples.



The mouse ortholog gene 16678 and its human ortholog 3848 exhibit several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes display abnormal morphologies in the heart, lung, spleen, and thymus, along with decreased circulating chloride levels, decreased grip strength, and enlargement of the heart, spleen, and thymus. Additionally, males exhibit abnormal seminal vesicle and testis morphologies, increased CD4-positive, CD25-positive, alpha-beta regulatory T cell numbers, and smaller epididymis and testis sizes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.626 (23.03rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 1.901 at pH 7.0 (57.17th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.017 (93.92nd percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 21.58% helix (1.72nd percentile), 26.09% sheet (11.52nd percentile), and 46.27% turn (99.3rd percentile). The instability index is 57.62 (78.39th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.15 (60.49th percentile). The protein has a length of 644 amino acids (71.78th percentile) and a molecular weight of 66037.94 Da (67.9th percentile).
