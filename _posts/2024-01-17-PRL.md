The gene acts upstream of [negative regulation of endothelial cell proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001937) and enables [prolactin receptor binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005148), [hormone activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005179), and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576) and is active in the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615). The gene is involved in various processes including [cell surface receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007166), [female pregnancy](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007565), [lactation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007595), [positive regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008284), [negative regulation of angiogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016525), [mammary gland development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030879), [response to nutrient levels](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031667), [prolactin signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0038161), [positive regulation of canonical NF-kappaB signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043123), [positive regulation of receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046427), [positive regulation of miRNA transcription](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902895), and [positive regulation of lactation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1903489). Additionally, it is located in the [endosome lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031904).


The gene length is 477,071 base pairs (98.18% of all genes), the mature length is 2,095 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 83,508 base pairs (85.57% of all genes).


The gene PRL (NCBI ID: 5617) has been mentioned in [9,328 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PRL%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning PRL is 1936, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1980 and 1999.


The top five publications mentioning PRL, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Prolactin: structure, function, and regulation of secretion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11015620)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 39.83), "[A homologous radioimmunoassay for human prolactin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4631065)" (1973) (relative citation ratio: 38.26), "[A radioimmunoassay for human prolactin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5288775)" (1971) (relative citation ratio: 33.18), "[Effects of naloxone, morphine and methionine enkephalin on serum prolactin, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone and growth hormone.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/895378)" (1977) (relative citation ratio: 28.44), and "[Human prolactin and growth hormone release during surgery and other conditions of stress.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4634485)" (1972) (relative citation ratio: 28.15). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PRL](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000172179-PRL) is a hormone-related gene involved in cancer. Evidence supports its function at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is notably expressed in the pituitary gland, where it plays a role in hormone signaling. In the brain, it is associated with astrocytes and mixed functions. Additionally, PRL is expressed in the RS4;11 cell line and photoreceptor cells, where it contributes to visual perception. While the gene is unprognostic for Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma and Glioblastoma Multiforme, its role in other cancer types remains to be fully elucidated.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), [RNF2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6045), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [NFKB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4790), each shown to be regulating in one experiment.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including general disease, disease of anatomical entity, bone disease, connective tissue disease, and musculoskeletal system disease. More specifically, it highlights bone remodeling disease, hyperostosis, and Paget's disease of bone.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus, pituitary, and stomach, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (night), retina, Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi), placenta, pituitary, uterus corpus, and tongue.


The proteins are involved in various pathways, including cytokine signaling in the immune system, amyloids, immune system processes, signaling by ERBB4, growth hormone receptor signaling, nuclear signaling by ERBB4, prolactin receptor signaling, disease-related pathways, and signal transduction.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.229 (66.29th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -1.744 (44.02nd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.997 (28.34th percentile). The protein has a high instability index of 59.571 (82.29th percentile) and an isoelectric point of 6.502 (42.57th percentile). The sequence length is 227 amino acids (18.56th percentile) with a molecular weight of 25875.55 Da (19.22nd percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 0.352 for helix (76.23rd percentile), 0.357 for sheet (64.12th percentile), and 0.264 for turn (33.09th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
