[MTTP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000138823-MTTP) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, involved in disease variants and is an FDA-approved drug target. It is detected in some RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. MTTP is highly expressed in the liver and intestine, playing a role in lipid metabolism, and is also expressed in astrocytes with mixed functions. In cell lines, it is associated with liver cancer and metabolism, while in single cells, it is found in proximal enterocytes involved in digestion.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 6 experiments, [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066) with 5 experiments, [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 5 experiments, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) with 5 experiments, and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including immune system disease, hypersensitivity reaction disease, hypersensitivity reaction type II disease, autoimmune disease of the gastrointestinal tract, and celiac disease.


The MTTP gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Apolipoprotein A1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34226706) and [Apolipoprotein B levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), both of which map to the MeSH term [Apolipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001053) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, MTTP is associated with [FVC](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36641522), which maps to the MeSH term [Peak Expiratory Flow Rate](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D010366). Other associations include [Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), mapping to [Lipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008074), [Serum total protein levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), mapping to [Serum](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D044967), and [Total cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), mapping to [Cholesterol](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D002784). These mappings were achieved using the BioWordVec method, which is detailed [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the liver, small intestine, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, liver, small intestine, fetal liver, skeletal muscle, atrioventricular node, ciliary ganglion, and skin.


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in lipid metabolism and transport. These include chylomicron-mediated lipid transport, lipid digestion, mobilization, and transport, lipoprotein metabolism, and the broader categories of metabolism and metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins.
