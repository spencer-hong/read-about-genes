The gene length is 508,131 base pairs (98.42% of all genes), the mature length is 8,964 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 508,131 base pairs.


The gene STT3A, with NCBI ID 3703, has been featured in [39 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22STT3A%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1972, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning STT3A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[HLA-B51/B5 and the risk of Beh√ßet's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control genetic association studies.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19790126)" (2009) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 8.52, "[Tmc gene therapy restores auditory function in deaf mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26157030)" (2015) with an RCR of 6.9, "[Femtomolar level detection of RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene methylation by electrochemical nano-genosensor based on Fe3O4/TMC/Au nanocomposite and PT-modified electrode.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26562330)" (2016) with an RCR of 2.47, "[Cohort Profile: The Malaysian Cohort (TMC) project: a prospective study of non-communicable diseases in a multi-ethnic population.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24729425)" (2015) with an RCR of 2.14, and "[Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) genes are required for auditory and vestibular mechanosensation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25074487)" (2015) with an RCR of 2.06. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYOD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4654), [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [NEUROD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4760), [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980), and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), each with 5 experiments demonstrating their regulatory roles.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.237 (91.2% percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 4.823 (67.46% percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.983 (6.53% percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, turn, and sheet structures of 28.23% (18.4% percentile), 25.11% (22.29% percentile), and 46.24% (95.66% percentile), respectively. The instability index is 37.53 (15.4% percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.278 (62.44% percentile). The protein is 705 amino acids long (75.58% percentile) with a molecular weight of 80528.65 Da (76.52% percentile).
