The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[FAAH](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000117480-FAAH) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is expressed in the cytosol and is detected in all tissues. It is notably expressed in eosinophils within the blood, the parathyroid gland for tissue expression, white matter in the brain, ciliated cells in cell lines, and proximal enterocytes in single-cell expression clusters. The gene's expression is associated with various biological processes, including transcription, vesicular transport, myelination, ion channel activity, and digestion.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CNOT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4849) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 3 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 3 experiments, and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent detection in multiple experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as mental health conditions like cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder.


Genome-wide association studies have linked FAAH to various metabolite levels and diseases. Notably, FAAH is associated with [Linoleoyl ethanolamide levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36635386), which maps to [Lysophosphatidylcholines](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008244) using the BioWordVec method.

FAAH is also linked to [Oleoyl ethanolamide levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36635386), mapping to [Monoglycerides](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D050178), and [Oleoyl glycine levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35995766), mapping to [Glycine](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005998). In the context of chronic kidney disease, FAAH is associated with [Oleoyl glycine levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35120996), mapping to [Disease](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004194), and [Plasma N-oleoylserine levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37277652), also mapping to [Disease](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004194).
