[CR2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000117322-CR2) functions as a host cell receptor for virus entry and is implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in some tissues and is associated with Cluster 18 in blood expression, which is non-specific and related to translation. In tissue expression, it is part of Cluster 36, linked to lymphoid tissue and cytokine signaling. Additionally, CR2 is found in Cluster 55 in cell line expression, associated with lymphoma and immune response, and in Cluster 73 in single-cell expression, related to B-cells and B-cell function.
