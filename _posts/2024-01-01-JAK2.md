The gene length is 1,307,536.0 base pairs (99.84% of all genes), the mature length is 4,478.0 base pairs (87.43% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 988,287.0 base pairs (99.9% of all genes).


The gene JAK2 (NCBI ID: 3717) has been featured in [3,242 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22JAK2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning JAK2, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[A gain-of-function mutation of JAK2 in myeloproliferative disorders.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15858187)" (2005) with a relative citation ratio of 52.27. Following this, "[Acquired mutation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in human myeloproliferative disorders.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15781101)" (2005) has a relative citation ratio of 51.24. Additionally, "[A unique clonal JAK2 mutation leading to constitutive signalling causes polycythaemia vera.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15793561)" (2005) has a relative citation ratio of 50.61. More recently, "[TH17 responses in cytokine storm of COVID-19: An emerging target of JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32205092)" (2020) has a relative citation ratio of 42.92. Lastly, "[Activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15837627)" (2005) has a relative citation ratio of 42.83.

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SRF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6722) with 6 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 5 experiments, [TAF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872) with 5 experiments, [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 5 experiments, and [CEBPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1050) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The JAK2 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Eosinophil counts](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494) and [Eosinophil percentage of white cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), both of which map to the MeSH term [Eosinophils](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004804) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, JAK2 is associated with [HDL cholesterol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30275531), which maps directly to the MeSH term [Cholesterol, HDL](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008076). Other associations include [High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887591), mapping to [Lipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008074), and [LDL cholesterol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30275531), mapping directly to [Cholesterol, LDL](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008078). Furthermore, JAK2 is linked to [Mean platelet volume](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34226706), mapping directly to [Mean Platelet Volume](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D063847), and [Platelet count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24777453), mapping directly to [Platelet Count](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D010976). Other traits include [Plateletcrit](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863252), mapping to [Blood Platelets](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001792), [Red blood cell count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), mapping directly to [Erythrocyte Count](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004906), and [Total cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083408), mapping to [Cholesterol](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D002784).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.433 (42.37th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature.
