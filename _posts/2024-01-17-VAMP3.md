[VAMP3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000049245-VAMP3) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is notably expressed in monocytes and neutrophils involved in degranulation (Cluster 38). In tissue expression, VAMP3 is associated with oligodendrocytes and myelination (Cluster 9), and in the brain, it is linked to white matter and myelination (Cluster 30). Additionally, VAMP3 is involved in non-specific mRNA processing in cell lines (Cluster 37) and has mixed functions in single-cell expression (Cluster 45).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149) with 5 experiments, [KLF5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/688) with 4 experiments, [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065) with 4 experiments, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 4 experiments, and [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal disease, Crohn's disease, gastrointestinal system disease, and cerebrovascular disease.


VAMP3 has been associated with [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36224396) in genome-wide association studies.


The gene is expressed in a variety of tissues, including adipose tissue, nerve, and blood vessel, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, retina, spinal cord, adipocytes, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, and placenta.



The mouse ortholog gene 22319 and its human ortholog gene 9341 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.059 (80.79th percentile), indicating a slightly hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 1.501 (55.58th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.007 (70.52nd percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 30.00% (32.08th percentile), 40.00% (86.27th percentile), and 23.00% (9.95th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 18.717 (0.47th percentile), suggesting high stability. The isoelectric point is 8.887 (76.14th percentile), with a molecular weight of 11308.96 Da (2.84th percentile).
