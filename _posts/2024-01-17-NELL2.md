The gene is involved in [fertilization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009566), [neuron cellular homeostasis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070050), and [commissural neuron axon guidance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071679).


The gene length is 79,480.0 base pairs (77.24% of all genes), the mature length is 1,794.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 77,971.5 base pairs.


The gene NELL2 (NCBI ID: 4753) has been mentioned in [22 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NELL2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1996 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2008 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning NELL2, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[m6A demethylase FTO induces NELL2 expression by inhibiting E2F1 m6A modification leading to metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34169146)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 2.6), "[Biochemical characterization and expression analysis of neural thrombospondin-1-like proteins NELL1 and NELL2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10548494)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 2.31), "[Cloning and characterization of two novel human cDNAs (NELL1 and NELL2) encoding proteins with six EGF-like repeats.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8975702)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 2.02), "[NELL2 modulates cell proliferation and apoptosis via ERK pathway in the development of benign prostatic hyperplasia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34195782)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.71), and "[NELL2-Robo3 complex structure reveals mechanisms of receptor activation for axon guidance.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32198364)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.63). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[NELL2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000184613-NELL2) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many tissues. It is primarily localized in vesicles and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 43 for non-specific transcription and translation in blood, Cluster 60 for transmembrane transport in choroid plexus tissue, Cluster 51 for mixed function in neurons within the brain, Cluster 12 for neuronal signaling in bone cancer cell lines, and Cluster 34 for neuronal signaling in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), each with 6 experiments. Following these are [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) was found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, bipolar disorder, mood disorder, substance-related disorder, substance dependence, alcohol dependence, bone inflammation disease, arthritis, bone disease, connective tissue disease, musculoskeletal system disease, osteoarthritis, female reproductive system disease, reproductive system disease, ovarian disease, and premature ovarian failure.



The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the amygdala, fetal brain, subthalamic nucleus, occipital lobe, and globus pallidus. Additionally, it is expressed in immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The gene is also found in the pituitary gland.
