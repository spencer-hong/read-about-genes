The gene enables [DNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003677) and [DNA-binding transcription factor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003700), and is involved in [regulation of DNA-templated transcription](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006355). It also enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [PH domain binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042731), [insulin receptor substrate binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043560), and [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872). Additionally, the gene is involved in [negative regulation of insulin receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046627) and [regulation of peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050730). It is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634).


The gene length is 4,623 base pairs (12.98% of all genes), the mature length is 1,757 base pairs (45.89% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 4,619 base pairs (17.23% of all genes).


ZNF592 has been mentioned in [3 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ZNF592%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2002, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2007.


The top publications mentioning ZNF592 include "[The association between body mass index and health-related quality of life: data from CaMos, a stratified population study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17957495)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 1.86), "[Clear cell carcinoma in a background of endometriosis. Case report of a finding in a midline abdominal scar 5 years after a total abdominal hysterectomy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18702369)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 0.89), and "[A new autosomal recessive non-progressive congenital cerebellar ataxia associated with mental retardation, optic atrophy, and skin abnormalities (CAMOS) maps to chromosome 15q24-q26 in a large consanguineous Lebanese Druze Family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12030328)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 0.47). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ZNF592](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000166716-ZNF592) is a DNA-binding protein with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the nucleoplasm. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 2 in dendritic cells with unknown function, Cluster 19 in non-specific tissues involved in basic cellular processes, Cluster 30 in brain white matter related to myelination, Cluster 58 in cell lines involved in nuclear processes, and Cluster 37 in glandular and luminal cells with unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [CREB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1385), [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, disease of metabolism, acquired metabolic disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, mood disorder, substance-related disorder, substance dependence, alcohol dependence, psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, endogenous depression, major depressive disorder, mental depression, iron metabolism disease, and mineral metabolism disease.


The gene ZNF592 has been associated with [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36224396) through genome-wide association studies.


The gene is expressed in the nerve tissue. Additionally, it is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including the liver, CD19+ B cells (negatively selected), Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi), CD71+ early erythroid cells, the caudate nucleus, and lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4).



The mouse ortholog gene 233410 and its human ortholog gene 9640 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.584 (26.65th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 11.45 at pH 7.0 (84.18th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.01 (81.21st percentile).
