The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GFPT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198380-GFPT1) is a gene encoding a protein with aminotransferase and transferase molecular functions. It is implicated in congenital myasthenic syndrome and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoplasm, nucleoli, and nucleoli fibrillar center. Its expression is associated with cell proliferation in blood, digestion in the intestine, metabolism in the brain, and mixed functions in cell lines. Additionally, it is specifically expressed in intestinal goblet cells, contributing to mucin production.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 6 experiments, [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 5 experiments, [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 5 experiments, [REST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5978) with 5 experiments, and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.




The gene GFPT1 has been associated with [ICD10 M51: Intervertebral disc disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35110524), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Spondylosis](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D055009) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the pituitary and colon, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, pancreas, pancreatic islet, colon, and testis.


The input data highlights various diseases and processes related to glycosylation, particularly asparagine N-linked glycosylation. Notably, defects in several genes, including ALG2, ALG3, ALG6, ALG8, ALG9, DPAGT1, MAN1B1, MGAT2, MOGS, MPDU1, ALG1, ALG12, ALG11, ALG14, and RFT1, are associated with specific congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) and other conditions like congenital myasthenic syndrome. Additionally, the data covers broader categories such as diseases associated with N-glycosylation of proteins, post-translational protein modification, biosynthesis of N-glycan precursors, and metabolism of proteins. The synthesis of substrates in N-glycan biosynthesis and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are also mentioned, with specific pathways involving IRE1alpha and XBP1(S) activation of chaperones.


The mouse ortholog gene 14583, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 2673, is associated with several phenotypic outcomes. These include embryonic lethality prior to the tooth bud stage, persistence of the hyaloid vascular system, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. Notably, the persistence of the hyaloid vascular system and preweaning lethality are observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.278 (60.35th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -2.51 (41.19th percentile).
