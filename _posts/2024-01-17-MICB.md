[MICB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204516-MICB) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many tissues. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane. The gene is associated with Cluster 42 in blood expression, indicating involvement in vesicular transport, and Cluster 47 in tissue expression, suggesting a role in the immune response, particularly in the spleen. In cell line expression, it is part of Cluster 20, linked to myeloma and immune response, and in single-cell expression, it is part of Cluster 52, associated with cell proliferation. The gene is unprognostic for several cancer types, including Breast Invasive Carcinoma, Colon Adenocarcinoma, Glioblastoma Multiforme, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Ovary Serous Cystadenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, and Testicular Germ Cell Tumor.

Other associations include [Serum levels of protein MICB](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35078996), which maps to [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506), and [Triglyceride levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32203549), mapping to [Triglycerides](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D014280), both identified through embedding match.


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung, blood, and spleen. Additionally, it is expressed in various cell types such as B lymphoblasts, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, B cells, whole blood, and leukemia cells, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562) and lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4).


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in the immune system, including the adaptive immune system and immunoregulatory interactions between lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. These pathways are crucial for the body's defense mechanisms and the regulation of immune responses.
