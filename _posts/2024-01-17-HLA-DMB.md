The gene is involved in various biological processes, including the [adaptive immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002250), [MHC class II protein complex assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002399), and [peptide antigen assembly with MHC class II protein complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002503). It enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [MHC class II protein complex binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0023026), and is active in the [lysosomal membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005765) and [late endosome membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031902). Additionally, it is involved in [antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019886), [positive regulation of T cell proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042102), [positive regulation of immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050778), and [positive regulation of T cell activation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050870). The gene is also part of the [MHC class II protein complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042613) and is located in the [intracellular membrane-bounded organelle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043231). Furthermore, it is involved in the [positive regulation of T cell activation via T cell receptor contact with antigen bound to MHC molecule on antigen presenting cell](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:2001190).


The gene length is 5,767 base pairs (15.95th percentile), the mature length is 3,584 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 5,658 base pairs (20.72nd percentile).


The gene HLA-DMB, with NCBI ID 3109, has been mentioned in [13 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22HLA-DMB%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1996 and 2006.


The top 5 publications mentioning HLA-DMB, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Increased HLA-DMB expression in the tumor epithelium is associated with increased CTL infiltration and improved prognosis in advanced-stage serous ovarian cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19047092)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 1.79), "[HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB gene expression functions through the conserved S-X-Y region.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9144496)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 0.72), "[Genomic organization of HLA-DMA and HLA-DMB. Comparison of the gene organization of all six class II families in the human major histocompatibility complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8034636)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 0.67), "[Boy with a ring 7 chromosome: a case report with special reference to dermatological findings.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8922097)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 0.44), and "[HLA-DMB expression by thyrocytes: indication of the antigen-processing and possible presenting capability of thyroid cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10209506)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 0.37). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[HLA-DMB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000242574-HLA-DMB) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and it is primarily localized in vesicles. The gene is highly expressed in the spleen, contributing to immune response functions (Cluster 47). In the brain, it is involved in non-specific metabolism (Cluster 21). Additionally, HLA-DMB is expressed in lymphoma cell lines, playing a role in humoral immune response (Cluster 46), and is particularly active in dendritic cells, facilitating antigen presentation (Cluster 28).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments, [H2AZ1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3015) with 4 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 4 experiments, and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are highlighted. Cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease and vascular disease, are also noted. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia, are part of the dataset, along with musculoskeletal conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including lung, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD33+ Myeloid cells, BDCA4+ Dendritic Cells, CD19+ B Cells (neg. sel.), CD14+ Monocytes, Lung, Tonsil, and Lymph node.


The proteins are involved in several key immune-related pathways, including the adaptive immune system, the broader immune system, and MHC class II antigen presentation.
