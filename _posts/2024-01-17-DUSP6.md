[DUSP6](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000139318-DUSP6) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase and protein phosphatase molecular functions. It is implicated in diseases such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and Kallmann syndrome. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. It is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 42 for non-specific vesicular transport in blood, Cluster 77 for bone marrow cell proliferation, Cluster 23 for mixed function in the brain, Cluster 69 for skin cancer ECM organization in cell lines, and Cluster 29 for monocytes' innate immune response in single cells.

The input data highlights various pathways involved in the immune system, particularly the innate immune system. Key pathways include NGF signaling via TRKA from the plasma membrane, signaling by NGF, and multiple toll-like receptor (TLR) cascades such as TLR4, TLR3, TLR10, TLR5, TLR7/8, and TLR9. These pathways involve MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent cascades, TRIF-mediated signaling, and TRAF6-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the data covers MAP kinase activation, ERK/MAPK targets, and nuclear events related to kinase and transcription factor activation. Overall, the data emphasizes signal transduction processes within the immune system.
