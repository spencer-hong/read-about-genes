The gene RBMS1 (NCBI ID: 5937) has been mentioned in [120 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RBMS1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2014.


The top 5 publications mentioning RBMS1 include "[RBMS1 regulates lung cancer ferroptosis through translational control of SLC7A11.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34609966)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 8.03), "[YC-1: a potential anticancer drug targeting hypoxia-inducible factor 1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12671019)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 7.88), "[YC-1 inhibited human platelet aggregation through NO-independent activation of soluble guanylate cyclase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8640334)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 4.46), "[Mechanism of YC-1-induced activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9443939)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 4.46), and "[RBMS1 promotes gastric cancer metastasis through autocrine IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35361764)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 3.92). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RBMS1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000153250-RBMS1) is a gene with molecular functions that include DNA-binding and RNA-binding. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localized in the cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 21 in neutrophils with unknown function, Cluster 62 in connective tissue involved in ECM organization, Cluster 20 in macrophages and microglia related to immune response, Cluster 26 in non-specific cell lines with mitochondria and RNA binding functions, and Cluster 15 in single cells with mixed functions. Evidence for RBMS1 is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 6 experiments, [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 5 experiments, [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 5 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, and [CREB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1385) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including leukocyte disease, leukopenia, hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, disease of metabolism, acquired metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism disease, glucose metabolism disease, diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, nervous system disease, central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, mood disorder, inherited metabolic disorder, lipid metabolism disorder, arteriosclerosis, synucleinopathy, Parkinson's disease, mental depression, agranulocytosis, neutropenia, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorder, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, developmental disorder of mental health, specific developmental disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and sensory system disease.


The gene RBMS1 has been associated with [Glucose levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594039) through genome-wide association studies. The closest MeSH match for this trait is [Glucose](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005947), identified using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.
