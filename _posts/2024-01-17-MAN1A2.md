[MAN1A2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198162-MAN1A2) is a gene encoding a protein with glycosidase and hydrolase molecular functions. Evidence for this protein is available at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized in the Golgi apparatus. MAN1A2 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 3 for blood expression related to nuclear processes, Cluster 68 for tissue expression related to protein processing, Cluster 16 for brain expression related to transcription, Cluster 37 for cell line expression related to mRNA processing, and Cluster 4 for single cell expression in extravillous trophoblasts with an unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [HIF1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3091) with 6 experiments, [TRIM24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8805) with 5 experiments, [KDM5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10765) with 5 experiments, [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980) with 5 experiments, and [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq studies.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, and general disease categories. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of various respiratory and broader disease conditions.


The genome-wide association study has identified a link between the gene MAN1A2 and [serum levels of protein MAN1A2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35078996). The closest MeSH match for this trait is [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506), determined using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus and fallopian tube, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the prefrontal cortex, placenta, appendix, and superior cervical ganglion.


The input data highlights various diseases and processes related to glycosylation, particularly asparagine N-linked glycosylation. Notably, defects in specific proteins such as ALG2, ALG3, ALG6, ALG8, ALG9, DPAGT1, MAN1B1, MGAT2, MOGS, MPDU1, ALG1, ALG12, ALG11, ALG14, and RFT1 are linked to distinct congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) and other conditions like congenital myasthenic syndrome. These defects impact post-translational protein modification, metabolism of proteins, and transport to the Golgi, affecting processes such as N-glycan trimming and elongation in the cis-Golgi.
