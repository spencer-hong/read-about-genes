The gene length is 317,337 base pairs (96.19% of all genes), the mature length is 8,243 base pairs (97.91% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 317,337 base pairs (98.06% of all genes).


The gene CSTB (NCBI ID: 1476) has been the subject of [120 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CSTB%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1965, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1998 and 2016.


The top five publications mentioning CSTB, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Dodecamer repeat expansion in cystatin B gene in progressive myoclonus epilepsy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9126745)" (1997) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 4.91, "[Progressive ataxia, myoclonic epilepsy and cerebellar apoptosis in cystatin B-deficient mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9806543)" (1998) with an RCR of 4.63, "[Clinical picture of EPM1-Unverricht-Lundborg disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18325013)" (2008) with an RCR of 3.59, "[Evaluation of CSTB and DMBT1 expression in saliva of gastric cancer patients and controls.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35488257)" (2022) with an RCR of 3.36, and "[Localization of the EPM1 gene for progressive myoclonus epilepsy on chromosome 21: linkage disequilibrium allows high resolution mapping.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8104628)" (1993) with an RCR of 3.28. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ARID2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/196528) with 6 experiments, followed by [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341), [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088), [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829), and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each with 5 experiments.


The transcription factor [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) was found to be regulating genes in 5 Perturb-seq experiments, according to data from GTRD's database of transcription factor binding sites and the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).





The mouse ortholog gene 13014 and its human ortholog gene 1476 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal eye anterior chamber depth, which is not observed in both sexes, as well as abnormal retina outer nuclear layer morphology, decreased total retina thickness, and short tibia, all of which are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.546 (30.34th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -0.062 (50.15th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.006 (66.17th percentile). The protein has a predicted affinity for helix and sheet structures of 32.7% (56.5th percentile) and 34.7% (56.7th percentile), respectively, with a turn affinity of 23.5% (12.3rd percentile). The instability index is 39.3 (20.29th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.96 (49.94th percentile). The protein sequence is 98 amino acids long (2.53rd percentile) with a molecular weight of 11139.45 Da (2.7th percentile).
