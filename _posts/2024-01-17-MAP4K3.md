The gene length is 20,398 base pairs (42.51% of all genes), the mature length is 2,177 base pairs (57.09% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 19,312 base pairs (50.74% of all genes).


The gene MAP4K3 (NCBI ID: 8491) has been mentioned in [20 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MAP4K3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 2009, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning MAP4K3, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[MicroRNA let-7c inhibits migration and invasion of human non-small cell lung cancer by targeting ITGB3 and MAP4K3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23981581)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 5.48). Following this, "[MAP4K3 mediates amino acid-dependent regulation of autophagy via phosphorylation of TFEB.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29507340)" (2018) has a relative citation ratio of 3.3. Additionally, "[Long Intergenic Non-Protein Coding RNA 665 Regulates Viability, Apoptosis, and Autophagy via the MiR-186-5p/MAP4K3 Axis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31433582)" (2019) has a relative citation ratio of 2.87.

[MAP4K3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000011566-MAP4K3) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, implicated in cancer-related genes. Evidence supports its function at the protein level, and it is detected in all RNA tissue distributions. The protein is localized in the centriolar satellite. MAP4K3 is expressed in various tissues, including those with non-specific functions (Cluster 3), and is particularly notable in neurons, where it plays a role in synaptic function (Cluster 65). Its expression in the brain is associated with transcription (Cluster 31), and in cell lines, it is found in mucus-secreting cells with unknown function (Cluster 2).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) and [ARID2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/196528), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), and [RARA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5914) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, cerebrovascular disease, and general disease of anatomical entities.


MAP4K3 has been associated with [Bone mineral density](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31790847), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Bone Density](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015519) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, prefrontal cortex, thyroid, amygdala, fetal brain, smooth muscle, placenta, and uterus.
