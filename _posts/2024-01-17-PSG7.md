The gene is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576) and is active in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and [cell surface](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009986). It is involved in the [regulation of immune system process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002682), [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165), and [female pregnancy](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007565). Additionally, it enables [protein tyrosine kinase binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990782).


The gene length is 117,586 base pairs (84.86% of all genes), the mature length is 3,140 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 3,549 base pairs.


There are no publications that mention this gene.



[PSG7](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000221878-PSG7) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, and it is notably expressed in the placenta during pregnancy (Cluster 58). In the brain, it shows non-specific expression related to transcription (Cluster 15). Additionally, PSG7 is expressed in neuronal cell lines involved in signal transduction (Cluster 72) and is specifically found in syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy (Cluster 27).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 2 experiments. Additionally, [DTL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51514), [BATF3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55509), and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) were each found to be regulating in 1 experiment.




The genome-wide association study has identified a trait related to [Putative pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 7 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354).


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the liver, bladder, and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, pons, colorectal adenocarcinoma, placenta, trigeminal ganglion, skin, and ovary.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.394 (46.9th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 5.06 at pH 7.0 (68.3rd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.000 (41.75th percentile). The protein's secondary structure affinities are 22.7% for helix (2.22nd percentile), 41.5% for sheet (89.82nd percentile), and 33.7% for turn (84.62nd percentile). The instability index is 39.34 (20.35th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.65 (70.02nd percentile). The protein has a length of 419 amino acids (47.96th percentile) and a molecular weight of 47026.65 Da (48.36th percentile).
