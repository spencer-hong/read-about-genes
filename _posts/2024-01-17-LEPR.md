[LEPR](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000116678-LEPR) is a receptor involved in various diseases, including cancer-related genes, FDA approved drug targets, and obesity. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the liver, where it is associated with metabolism. Subcellularly, LEPR is localized to vesicles, the plasma membrane, primary cilium, basal body, and cytosol. In the brain, it is particularly expressed in the choroid plexus, while in cell lines, it is associated with leukemia and hemostasis. Single-cell expression data indicate its involvement in fibroblasts and ECM organization.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 6 experiments, [CREB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1385) with 5 experiments, [KLF5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/688) with 5 experiments, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 5 experiments, and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data highlights a diverse range of disease conditions associated with GWAS studies, including various forms of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and organ system cancers, particularly those affecting the hematologic, immune, and nervous systems. Additionally, respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are noted. Metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity, are also prominent. Cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, are included, along with cognitive disorders and diseases of mental health. This comprehensive list underscores the broad applicability of GWAS in understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases.


The LEPR gene has been associated with variations in [C-reactive protein levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34226706), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, LEPR has been linked to the [soluble leptin receptor level in chronic kidney disease with hypertension and no diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35870639).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including liver and nerve, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD105+ endothelial cells, trachea, fetal liver, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, atrioventricular node, ciliary ganglion, and fetal lung.


The proteins are involved in signaling by leptin and signal transduction pathways.


The mouse ortholog gene 16847 and its human ortholog gene 3953 are associated with a range of phenotypic abnormalities. These include structural issues such as abnormal bone structure and decreased bone mineral content and density, as well as behavioral changes like abnormal gait, decreased locomotor activity, and impaired righting response. Additionally, there are metabolic alterations, including decreased circulating chloride levels and increased circulating levels of various substances such as HDL cholesterol, calcium, glucose, and phosphate. Organ-specific changes include enlarged liver, decreased heart and spleen weight, and decreased lean body mass. Notably, infertility is observed in both males and females, along with other sex-specific phenotypes like small seminal vesicles. Neurological symptoms such as tremors and trunk curl are also present. These findings highlight the broad impact of these orthologous genes on multiple physiological systems.
