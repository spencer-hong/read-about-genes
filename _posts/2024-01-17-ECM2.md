The gene enables [integrin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005178) and [heparin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008201), as well as [collagen V binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070052). It is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576) and the [interstitial matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005614), and is active in the [extracellular matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031012). The gene is involved in [cell-matrix adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007160), [positive regulation of cell-substrate adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010811), and [extracellular matrix organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030198).


The gene length is 7,440 base pairs (20.08% of all genes), the mature length is 879 base pairs (17.54% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 4,055.5 base pairs (15.17% of all genes).


The gene ECM2 (NCBI ID: 1842) has been mentioned in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ECM2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications ranging from 1997 to 2021. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top publications mentioning ECM2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[<i>ECM2</i> and <i>GLT8D2</i> in human pulmonary artery hypertension: fruits from weighted gene co-expression network analysis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34012575)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.32), "[Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ecm2 Modulates the Catalytic Steps of pre-mRNA Splicing.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33547186)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.74), "[Matrix glycoprotein SC1/ECM2 augments B lymphopoiesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9345023)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 0.47), and "[Lymphopoiesis and matrix glycoprotein SC1/ECM2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10036996)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 0.33). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ECM2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000106823-ECM2) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many tissues. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, nucleoli fibrillar center, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane. The gene is notably expressed in connective tissue, playing a role in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, as indicated by its tissue expression cluster (Cluster 62). Additionally, it is expressed in brainstem cells with mixed functions (Cluster 46), connective tissue cells (Cluster 64), and fibroblasts (Cluster 53), all involved in ECM organization.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 4 experiments, [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 2 experiments, [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024) with 2 experiments, [FOSL2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2355) with 2 experiments, and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 2 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as male reproductive organ cancer, testicular cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, intestinal cancer, large intestine cancer, gastrointestinal system cancer, lung cancer, and respiratory system cancer. Additionally, the data highlights metabolic disorders, specifically diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as cardiovascular system diseases, including heart disease. Kidney disease and urinary system disease are also noted. These findings suggest a broad spectrum of genetic influences on both cancerous and non-cancerous conditions affecting multiple organ systems.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, blood vessels, and the ovary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the spinal cord, adipocytes, trachea, appendix, superior cervical ganglion, atrioventricular node, and ciliary ganglion.
