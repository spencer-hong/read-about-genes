The gene CLIC1 (NCBI ID: 1192) has been mentioned in [88 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CLIC1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1963 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2011 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning CLIC1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Chloride channels in cancer: Focus on chloride intracellular channel 1 and 4 (CLIC1 AND CLIC4) proteins in tumor development and as novel therapeutic targets.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25546839)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 4.27), "[The intracellular chloride ion channel protein CLIC1 undergoes a redox-controlled structural transition.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14613939)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 3.51), "[CLIC1 recruits PIP5K1A/C to induce cell-matrix adhesions for tumor metastasis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33079727)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 3.51), "[Identification of metastasis-associated proteins involved in gallbladder carcinoma metastasis by proteomic analysis and functional exploration of chloride intracellular channel 1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19299076)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 3.36), and "[Metformin repositioning as antitumoral agent: selective antiproliferative effects in human glioblastoma stem cells, via inhibition of CLIC1-mediated ion current.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25361004)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 3.09). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CLIC1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000213719-CLIC1) is a gene with multiple molecular functions, including chloride channel, ion channel, oxidoreductase, and voltage-gated channel. It is involved in cancer-related genes and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the cytosol. CLIC1 is part of blood expression cluster 38, which is associated with monocytes and neutrophils degranulation, and tissue expression cluster 75, related to epithelium and extracellular exosomes. Additionally, it is found in brain expression cluster 12, which is non-specific and related to vasculature, and cell line expression cluster 28, which is non-specific and related to nuclear processes. In single-cell expression, it is part of cluster 45, which is non-specific and has mixed functions.
