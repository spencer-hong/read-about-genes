GRK2 (Gene NCBI ID: 156) has been mentioned in [323 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GRK2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1993 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2005 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning GRK2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Protein kinase C switches the Raf kinase inhibitor from Raf-1 to GRK-2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14654844)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 5.59), "[Selective regulation of Galpha(q/11) by an RGS domain in the G protein-coupled receptor kinase, GRK2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10567430)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 5.28), "[Snapshot of activated G proteins at the membrane: the Galphaq-GRK2-Gbetagamma complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16339447)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 4.25), "[Adrenal GRK2 upregulation mediates sympathetic overdrive in heart failure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17322894)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 4.17), and "[The complex G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) interactome unveils new physiopathological targets.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20590581)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 3.89). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GRK2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000173020-GRK2) is a kinase with serine/threonine-protein kinase and transferase molecular functions. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, vesicles, and cytosol. GRK2 is highly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, playing a role in the innate immune response. It is also expressed in lymphoid tissue and bone marrow, as well as in the cerebral cortex and leukemia cell lines. The gene is involved in signal transduction and DNA binding processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in multiple immune cell types such as CD33+ Myeloid cells, BDCA4+ Dendritic Cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B Cells, CD14+ Monocytes, and Whole Blood, suggesting a ubiquitous expression pattern across different tissue samples.


The input data highlights various signaling pathways and interactions, including those mediated by Hedgehog, DAP12, PDGF, FGFR, ERBB2, EGFR, NGF, GPCR, and calcium-dependent events. Additionally, it covers immune system processes, particularly the innate immune system, and disease-related signaling pathways. Notably, the data also includes activation of SMO and opioid signaling.
