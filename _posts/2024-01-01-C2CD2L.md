The gene length is 653,878 base pairs (99.03% of all genes), the mature length is 8,756 base pairs (98.36% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 652,899 base pairs (99.6% of all genes).


The gene C2CD2L, with NCBI ID 9854, has been featured in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22C2CD2L%22) (count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2004, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2018.


The top publications mentioning C2CD2L, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include "[Lipid transport by TMEM24 at ER-plasma membrane contacts regulates pulsatile insulin secretion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28209843)" (2017) with an RCR of 4.77, "[Insulin biosynthetic interaction network component, TMEM24, facilitates insulin reserve pool release.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24012759)" (2013) with an RCR of 0.79, "[The endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane tethering protein TMEM24 is a regulator of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34821358)" (2022) with an RCR of 0.45, and "[Identification and characterization of TMEM24 family genes in silico.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15289880)" (2004) with an RCR of 0.14. The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772) with 6 experiments, [NFYA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4800) with 5 experiments, [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942) with 5 experiments, [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024) with 5 experiments, and [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 71764 and its human ortholog gene 9854 are associated with the phenotype 'abnormal auditory brainstem response'. This phenotype was observed in a sex-specific manner.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.4001 (46.1% percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 1.3500 (55.07% percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.0098 (80.7% percentile). The protein has a high instability index of 58.82 (80.8% percentile) and an isoelectric point of 7.61 (55.32% percentile). The sequence length is 706 amino acids (75.64% percentile) with a molecular weight of 76180.39 Da (74.27% percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 0.3244 for helix (54.51% percentile), 0.3144 for sheet (36.38% percentile), and 0.3300 for turn (81.97% percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
