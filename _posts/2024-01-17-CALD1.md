The gene CALD1 (NCBI ID: 800) has been mentioned in [243 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CALD1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1982, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1991 and 2007.


The top 5 publications mentioning CALD1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The mechanism of Ca2+ regulation of vascular smooth muscle thin filaments by caldesmon and calmodulin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2947901)" (1987) (relative citation ratio: 7.26), "[The molecular anatomy of caldesmon.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1930128)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 5.89), "[Binding of caldesmon to smooth muscle myosin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3257755)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 4.56), "[Caldesmon is a Ca2+-regulatory component of native smooth-muscle thin filaments.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2934055)" (1985) (relative citation ratio: 4.53), and "[Modulation of human aorta smooth muscle cell phenotype: a study of muscle-specific variants of vinculin, caldesmon, and actin expression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3143999)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 4.44). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CALD1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000122786-CALD1) is a gene with molecular functions including actin-binding, calmodulin-binding, and muscle protein activity. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and actin filaments. CALD1 is highly expressed in neutrophils, contributing to degranulation, and is also expressed in smooth muscle tissue, where it is involved in extracellular matrix organization. In the brain, it is specifically expressed in the choroid plexus, associated with mitochondrial functions. Additionally, CALD1 is expressed in connective tissue cells and smooth muscle cells, playing roles in ECM organization and muscle contraction, respectively.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 5 experiments, followed by [MED12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019), and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), each with 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as breast cancer, thoracic cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and female breast cancer. Additionally, the data highlights associations with cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease, vascular disease, and artery disease. Neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, and cognitive disorders, are also represented. Furthermore, the data includes associations with immune system diseases, hepatobiliary diseases, gastrointestinal system diseases, and reproductive system diseases, specifically endometriosis. Endocrine system diseases, such as thyroid gland disease, Graves' disease, and hyperthyroidism, are also noted. Lastly, the data shows associations with hypersensitivity reactions and substance-related disorders, including alcohol dependence.


The gene CALD1 has been associated with [Resistance to COVID-19 infection (Exposed negative vs positive)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36662838), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Infections](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007239) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood vessel and esophagus, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, adipocytes, smooth muscle, prostate, colon, appendix, ovary, and uterus.


The proteins are involved in pathways related to muscle contraction, specifically smooth muscle contraction.
