The gene length is 1,181,214.0 base pairs (99.76% of all genes), the mature length is 7,121.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 1,181,214.0 base pairs (99.95% of all genes).


The gene SSB, with NCBI ID 6741, has been featured in [405 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SSB%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1981, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1992 and 2012.


The top five publications mentioning SSB, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[La autoantigen enhances and corrects aberrant translation of poliovirus RNA in reticulocyte lysate.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8389906)" (1993) with a relative citation ratio of 9.03, "[Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10473346)" (1999) with a relative citation ratio of 6.6, "[Binding of antibodies to the extractable nuclear antigens SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La is induced on the surface of human keratinocytes by ultraviolet light (UVL): implications for the pathogenesis of photosensitive cutaneous lupus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2132545)" (1990) with a relative citation ratio of 5.4, "[Identification of mothers at risk for congenital heart block and other neonatal lupus syndromes in their children. Comparison of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot for measurement of anti-SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La antibodies.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8216420)" (1993) with a relative citation ratio of 5.15, and "[Evaluation of the risk of anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La antibody-associated cardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus in fetuses of mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus exposed to hydroxychloroquine.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20447951)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 4.49. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [RNA-binding](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) is involved in Systemic lupus erythematosus and has evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily located in the nucleoplasm. The gene is part of Cluster 3 for blood expression, Cluster 16 for tissue expression, Cluster 23 for brain expression, Cluster 26 for cell line expression, and Cluster 39 for single cell expression, indicating its involvement in various nuclear processes, transcription, and basic cellular processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments, followed by [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [TAF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), each with 4 experiments.











The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.973284 (5.03rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -0.90207 (47.11th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.023869 (98.26th percentile), suggesting high flexibility. The protein has a notable affinity for helix structures (0.428922, 96.88th percentile), with a lower affinity for sheet (0.284314, 20.33rd percentile) and turn structures (0.254902, 25.11th percentile). The instability index is 38.0172 (16.87th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.6757 (45.84th percentile). The protein sequence is 408 amino acids long (46.41st percentile) with a molecular weight of 46836.48 Da (48.11th percentile).
