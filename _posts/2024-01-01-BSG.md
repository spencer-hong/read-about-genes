The gene length is 56,506 base pairs (69.57% of all genes), the mature length is 989 base pairs (22.11% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 50,790 base pairs (75.66% of all genes).


The gene BSG (NCBI ID: 682) has been the subject of [821 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22BSG%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1988, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning BSG, also known as CD147, include "[CD147-spike protein is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33277466)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 56.75, "[Distribution of ACE2, CD147, CD26, and other SARS-CoV-2 associated molecules in tissues and immune cells in health and in asthma, COPD, obesity, hypertension, and COVID-19 risk factors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32496587)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 25.64, "[CD147 as a Target for COVID-19 Treatment: Suggested Effects of Azithromycin and Stem Cell Engagement.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32307653)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 22.67, "[The roles of Eph receptors, neuropilin-1, P2X7, and CD147 in COVID-19-associated neurodegenerative diseases: inflammasome and JaK inhibitors as potential promising therapies.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35109786)" (2022) with a relative citation ratio of 11.05, and "[CD147-spike protein interaction in COVID-19: Get the ball rolling with a novel receptor and therapeutic target.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34863742)" (2022) with a relative citation ratio of 11.0. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) with 3 experiments, [ZNF274](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11091) with 2 experiments, [ZNF263](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) with 2 experiments, [ZNF592](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55929) with 2 experiments, and [ZNF559](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) with 2 experiments. These TFs were found to regulate gene expression in multiple Perturb-seq experiments, highlighting their significant roles in transcriptional regulation.


A recent genome-wide association study has identified significant associations with [Alzheimer's disease (late onset)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28714976), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Disease](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004194) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, the study found associations with [Endometriosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28881265), which directly matched the MeSH term [Endometriosis](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004715).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.323 (55.32nd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -13.36 (17.42nd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.003 (55.58th percentile). The protein has a predicted secondary structure with 29.35% helix (26.22nd percentile), 34.03% sheet (52.21st percentile), and 30.91% turn (69.97th percentile) affinities. The instability index is 41.02 (25.38th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.39 (15.69th percentile). The protein is 385 amino acids long (43.24th percentile) with a molecular weight of 42199.87 Da (42.41st percentile).
