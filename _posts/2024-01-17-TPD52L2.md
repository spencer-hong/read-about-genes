The gene enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), and is involved in the [carbohydrate metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005975).


The gene length is 28,838 base pairs (51.64% of all genes), the mature length is 3,339 base pairs (76.94% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 25,620 base pairs (58.44% of all genes).


The gene TPD52L2 (NCBI ID: 7165) has been mentioned in [23 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TPD52L2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2013 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2015 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning TPD52L2 include "[A tumor-suppressive microRNA, miRNA-485-5p, inhibits glioma cell proliferation and invasion by down-regulating TPD52L2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28804551)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.33), "[Tumor protein D54 defines a new class of intracellular transport vesicles.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31672706)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.92), "[MicroRNA-217 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration by targeting Tpd52l2 in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29039566)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 0.83), "[TPD52L2 Is a Prognostic Biomarker and Correlated With Immune Infiltration in Lung Adenocarcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34744715)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.8), and "[Tumor protein D54 binds intracellular nanovesicles via an extended amphipathic region.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35714773)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 0.79). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TPD52L2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000101150-TPD52L2) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in vesicles and the cytosol. The gene is expressed in blood, specifically in Cluster 38, which is associated with monocytes and neutrophils degranulation. In tissues, it is part of Cluster 77, linked to bone marrow cell proliferation. Additionally, TPD52L2 is found in various expression clusters in the brain, cell lines, and single cells, all with non-specific or mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) with 6 experiments, [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757) with 5 experiments, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 5 experiments, [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) with 5 experiments, and [RXRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6256) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent detection in multiple experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including CD14+ monocytes, whole blood, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and lung tissue.
