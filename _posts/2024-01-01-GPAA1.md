The gene length is 1,201,631 base pairs (99.78th percentile of all genes), the mature length is 3,101 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 1,201,631 base pairs (99.96th percentile of all genes).


The gene GPAA1 has an NCBI gene ID of 8733. It has been featured in [11 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GPAA1%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1977, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2001 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning GPAA1, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[A novel variant in GPAA1, encoding a GPI transamidase complex protein, causes inherited vascular anomalies with various phenotypes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32533362)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.65), "[A conserved proline in the last transmembrane segment of Gaa1 is required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) recognition by GPI transamidase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14660601)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 0.57), "[Very late-onset Friedreich's ataxia with minimal GAA1 expansion mimicking multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16092110)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.55), "[External-cavity-controlled 32-MHz narrow-band cw GaA1As-diode lasers.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19680331)" (1977) (relative citation ratio: 0.47), and "[Structural modelling of the lumenal domain of human GPAA1, the metallo-peptide synthetase subunit of the transamidase complex, reveals zinc-binding mode and two flaps surrounding the active site.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32993792)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.23). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [E2F6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1876), and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 14731 and its human ortholog 8733 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal embryo size and embryonic growth retardation. Additionally, there is embryonic lethality prior to the tooth bud stage, although this is not observed in both sexes. Furthermore, complete penetrance preweaning lethality is noted in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.396 (93.62nd percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity. The charge at pH 7.0 is 2.984 (61.28th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.986 (8.39th percentile). The protein has a notable affinity for helix (0.395, 92.41st percentile) and sheet (0.425, 91.6th percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (0.242, 15.96th percentile). The instability index is 37.718 (15.95th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.153 (60.53rd percentile). The sequence length is 621 amino acids (70.07th percentile), with a molecular weight of 67622.39 Da (68.94th percentile).
