The gene is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739) and specifically in the [mitochondrial inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005743). It is part of the [mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005753), including the [coupling factor F(o)](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000276). The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [lipid binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008289), and it has [proton transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015078). It is involved in [proton motive force-driven ATP synthesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015986) and [proton transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902600).


The gene length is 66,611 base pairs (73.51% of all genes), the mature length is 5,799 base pairs (93.52% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 66,611 base pairs (81.46% of all genes).


The gene ATP5MC1 (NCBI ID: 516) has been mentioned in [21 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ATP5MC1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1990, with the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1994 and 1997.


The top 5 publications mentioning ATP5MC1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit c storage in the ceroid-lipofuscinoses (Batten disease).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1535179)" (1992) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 8.29, "[RNA editing of wheat mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit 9: direct protein and cDNA sequencing.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1726783)" (1990) with an RCR of 2.16, "[Specific delay of degradation of mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit c in late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7830067)" (1995) with an RCR of 1.67, "[Abnormal degradative pathway of mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit c in late infantile neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (Batten disease).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7668341)" (1995) with an RCR of 1.25, and "[Evaluation of mRNA expression level of the ATP synthase membrane subunit c locus 1 (<i>ATP5G1</i>) gene in patients with schizophrenia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35243015)" (2022) with an RCR of 0.97. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ATP5MC1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000159199-ATP5MC1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 13 for non-specific mitochondrial function in blood, Cluster 23 for non-specific cellular respiration in tissues, Cluster 14 for neurons and synaptic function in the brain, Cluster 27 for breast cancer in cell lines, and Cluster 39 for non-specific basic cellular processes in single cells. The gene is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725) with 6 experiments, [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 5 experiments, [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 5 experiments, [FOXM1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2305) with 5 experiments, and [ME3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10873) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, colon, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, CD105+ endothelial cells, whole brain, colon, and small intestine.


The proteins are involved in various metabolic processes, including the metabolism of proteins, general metabolism, formation of ATP by chemiosmotic coupling, respiratory electron transport, ATP synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling, heat production by uncoupling proteins, the citric acid (TCA) cycle, and mitochondrial protein import.
