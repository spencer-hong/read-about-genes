The gene SORT1 (NCBI ID: 6272) has been mentioned in [214 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SORT1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1986 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2011 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning SORT1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[From noncoding variant to phenotype via SORT1 at the 1p13 cholesterol locus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20686566)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 16.68, "[ProBDNF induces neuronal apoptosis via activation of a receptor complex of p75NTR and sortilin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15930396)" (2005) with a relative citation ratio of 16.61, "[Sortilin is essential for proNGF-induced neuronal cell death.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14985763)" (2004) with a relative citation ratio of 15.7, "[Sortilin-mediated endocytosis determines levels of the frontotemporal dementia protein, progranulin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21092856)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 9.31, and "[Sortilin controls intracellular sorting of brain-derived neurotrophic factor to the regulated secretory pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15987945)" (2005) with a relative citation ratio of 6.41. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[SORT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134243-SORT1) is a developmental protein and receptor with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and cytosol. SORT1 is part of Cluster 25 in blood expression, which has non-specific and unknown functions. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 54, involved in basic cellular processes. Notably, SORT1 is part of Cluster 11 in brain expression, associated with white matter and signal transduction, and Cluster 9 in cell line expression, linked to skin cancer and melanin biosynthesis. Additionally, it is part of Cluster 51 in single-cell expression, associated with oligodendrocytes.

The SORT1 gene has been associated with several diseases and traits through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Alzheimer's disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35379992), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Alzheimer Disease](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000544) via a direct synonym match. Additionally, SORT1 has been implicated in the interaction between sex and psychiatric disorders, specifically [Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder x sex interaction (3df)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34099189), which maps to the MeSH term [Affect](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000339) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood vessels and the brain. Additionally, it is expressed in CD33+ myeloid cells, adipocytes, placenta, and multiple testis-related tissues such as Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and germ cells.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to vesicle dynamics and trafficking, including clathrin-derived vesicle budding, trans-Golgi network vesicle budding, Golgi-associated vesicle biogenesis, and membrane trafficking.


The mouse ortholog gene 20661 and its human ortholog gene 6272 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance, observed in both sexes.
