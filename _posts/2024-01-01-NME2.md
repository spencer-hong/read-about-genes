The gene length is 32,513 base pairs (54.84% of all genes), the mature length is 6,546 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 32,498 base pairs.


The gene NME2, with NCBI ID 4831, has been the subject of [202 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NME2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication dating back to 1977. The middle 50% of these publications were published between 2003 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning NME2, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows: ["Human c-myc transcription factor PuF identified as nm23-H2 nucleoside diphosphate kinase, a candidate suppressor of tumor metastasis."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8392752) (1993) (relative citation ratio: 9.75), ["Identification of a second human nm23 gene, nm23-H2."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1988104) (1991) (relative citation ratio: 9.45), ["A PUF family portrait: 3'UTR regulation as a way of life."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11858839) (2002) (relative citation ratio: 7.66), ["B Cell Receptor and CD40 Signaling Are Rewired for Synergistic Induction of the c-Myc Transcription Factor in Germinal Center B Cells."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29396161) (2018) (relative citation ratio: 6.48), and ["PUF proteins bind Pop2p to regulate messenger RNAs."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16715093) (2006) (relative citation ratio: 4.27). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908), [CREB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1385), [KLF5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/688), and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872) with 4 experiments, [IRF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) with 3 experiments, and [ZNF274](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028) with 2 experiments. Additionally, [FOS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623), [ZNF263](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6426), [MAFK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8243), [KLF16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861), and [ZNF781](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57634) were each found to be regulating in 1 experiment.





The mouse ortholog gene 18103 and its human ortholog 4831 are associated with several morphological abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal kidney, liver, and stomach morphologies, as well as enlarged kidneys. Additionally, abnormal and enlarged uterus morphologies are observed, although these phenotypes are not present in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.277 (60.55th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 1.86 (57.04th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.0005 (44.08th percentile). The protein has a predicted affinity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 32.24% (52.54th percentile), 35.53% (62.98th percentile), and 26.97% (37.71st percentile), respectively. The instability index is 31.72 (5.57th percentile), suggesting a stable protein. The isoelectric point is 8.52 (66.98th percentile), with a molecular weight of 17297.83 Da (8.63rd percentile). The sequence length is 152 amino acids (8.27th percentile).
