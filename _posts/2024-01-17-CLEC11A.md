The gene is involved in [ossification](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001503) and [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165), as well as the [positive regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008284). It enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [growth factor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008083), and [carbohydrate binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030246). The gene is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), and [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), and is active in the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615).


The gene length is 125,170 base pairs (85.97% of all genes), the mature length is 6,390 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 124,794 base pairs (91.49% of all genes).


The gene CLEC11A (NCBI ID: 6320) has been mentioned in [23 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CLEC11A%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning CLEC11A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Effect of early particulate air pollution exposure on obesity in mice: role of p47phox.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20864666)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 6.22), "[Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells-derived extracellular vesicles exert potent bone protective effects by CLEC11A-mediated regulation of bone metabolism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32089743)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 5.1), "[The interferon-inducible p47 (IRG) GTPases in vertebrates: loss of the cell autonomous resistance mechanism in the human lineage.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16277747)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 4.2), "[Clec11a/osteolectin is an osteogenic growth factor that promotes the maintenance of the adult skeleton.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27976999)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 2.56), and "[High glucose concentration in cell culture medium does not acutely affect human mesenchymal stem cell growth factor production or proliferation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19386985)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 1.78). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CLEC11A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105472-CLEC11A) is a growth factor with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized to the centrosome. In terms of expression, CLEC11A is found in dendritic cells with unknown function (Cluster 2) and is involved in non-specific transcription (Cluster 40). In the brain, it is associated with neurons and synapses, playing a role in synaptic function (Cluster 52). Additionally, CLEC11A is involved in the organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in connective tissue cells (Cluster 50).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) with 4 experiments, [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024) with 4 experiments, [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113) with 4 experiments, and [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.




The gene CLEC11A has been associated with [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34226706) through genome-wide association studies.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the fallopian tube and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (night), cardiac myocytes, CD34+ cells, CD33+ myeloid cells, smooth muscle, bone marrow, and uterus.
