The gene enables [chitinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004668) and [chitin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008061). It is located in the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615) and [lysosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005764). Additionally, it is involved in the [chitin catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006032) and [oligosaccharide catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009313).


The gene length is 20,311 base pairs (42.41% of all genes), the mature length is 1,849 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 20,270 base pairs (51.99% of all genes).


The gene CTBS (NCBI ID: 1486) has been mentioned in [17 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CTBS%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1972, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning CTBS, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[C-Tb skin test to diagnose Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in children and HIV-infected adults: A phase 3 trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30248152)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 1.6), "[Biochemical and immunological characterization of the plant-derived candidate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mucosal vaccine CTB-MPR.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19037902)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 1.33), "[Randomised clinical trial investigating the specificity of a novel skin test (C-Tb) for diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23691171)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.22), "[Integrated TCGA analysis implicates lncRNA CTB-193M12.5 as a prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29483846)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 1.15), and "[Temperature and cholera toxin B are factors that influence formation of membrane nanotubes in RT4 and T24 urothelial cancer cell lines.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21468353)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 0.94). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CTBS](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000117151-CTBS) is a gene encoding a protein with glycosidase and hydrolase molecular functions, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the cytosol. It is associated with Cluster 53 in tissue expression, which is non-specific but related to glycosylation. In brain expression, it is part of Cluster 50, which is non-specific but related to nucleic acid binding. In cell line expression, it belongs to Cluster 37, which is non-specific but related to mRNA processing. Additionally, in single cell expression, it is found in Cluster 74, which is specific to neutrophils and related to degranulation. The gene is unprognostic for several cancer types, including Breast Invasive Carcinoma, Glioblastoma Multiforme, Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Ovary Serous Cystadenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, and Prostate Adenocarcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments, followed by [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066), and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), each with 3 experiments.





The gene is expressed in the liver and blood according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate that the gene is expressed in the liver, CD33+ myeloid cells, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD14+ monocytes, whole blood, prostate, and pancreatic islet cells.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.344 (52.96th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -2.98 (39.82nd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.998 (30.79th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 28.83% (22.33rd percentile), 35.84% (65.2nd percentile), and 29.09% (56.7th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 55.94 (74.53rd percentile), with an isoelectric point of 6.19 (35.29th percentile). The sequence length is 385 amino acids (43.24th percentile), and the molecular weight is 43759.34 Da (44.25th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
