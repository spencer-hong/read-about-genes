The gene length is 1,899,594.0 base pairs (99.96% of all genes), the mature length is 3,215.5 base pairs (75.45% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 703,586.0 base pairs (99.65% of all genes).


The gene POM121, with NCBI ID 9883, has been featured in [25 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POM121%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1988, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2020. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning POM121, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> Repeat RNA Initiates a POM121-Mediated Reduction in Specific Nucleoporins in C9orf72 ALS/FTD.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32673563)" (2020) (RCR: 3.95), "[POM121 and Sun1 play a role in early steps of interphase NPC assembly.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21727197)" (2011) (RCR: 2.17), "[Capture of AT-rich chromatin by ELYS recruits POM121 and NDC1 to initiate nuclear pore assembly.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18596237)" (2008) (RCR: 1.97), "[Pom121 links two essential subcomplexes of the nuclear pore complex core to the membrane.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20974814)" (2010) (RCR: 1.56), and "[p145, a protein with associated tyrosine kinase activity in a human gastric carcinoma cell line.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3211149)" (1988) (RCR: 1.5). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [KDM5A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5927), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The genome-wide association study has identified a significant association between the POM121 gene and [Body mass index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595370). This trait was mapped to the closest existing MeSH term, [Body Mass Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015992), using the method called [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The mouse ortholog gene 107939 and its human ortholog 9883 are associated with phenotypes including embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, which is not observed in both sexes, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which is observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.344 (52.9th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 57.88 at pH 7.0 (99.61st percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.01 (80.09th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 27.0% helix (11.63rd percentile), 28.4% sheet (20.27th percentile), and 41.0% turn (97.89th percentile). The instability index is 71.0 (95.21st percentile), suggesting high instability. The isoelectric point is 10.58 (98.48th percentile), with a length of 1249 amino acids (92.51st percentile) and a molecular weight of 127718.74 Da (90.77th percentile).
