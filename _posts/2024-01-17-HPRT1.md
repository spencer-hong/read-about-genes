The gene length is 46,107 base pairs (64.25th percentile), the mature length is 2,113 base pairs (55.62nd percentile), and the primary transcript length is 38,543.5 base pairs (69.01st percentile).


The gene HPRT1 (NCBI ID: 3251) has been mentioned in [788 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22HPRT1%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1967, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1987 and 2001.


The top five publications mentioning HPRT1, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies such as "[HPRT-deficient (Lesch-Nyhan) mouse embryos derived from germline colonization by cultured cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3821905)" (1987) (relative citation ratio: 16.78), "[8-Azaguanine resistance in mammalian cells. I. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4345996)" (1972) (relative citation ratio: 8.91), "[Multiplex DNA deletion detection and exon sequencing of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene in Lesch-Nyhan families.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2347587)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 7.47), "[A potential animal model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome through introduction of HPRT mutations into mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3029599)" (1987) (relative citation ratio: 7.12), and "[Automated DNA sequencing of the human HPRT locus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2341149)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 7.04). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[HPRT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000165704-HPRT1) is a gene encoding a protein with glycosyltransferase and transferase molecular functions. It is involved in diseases such as gout and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. The protein has been detected at the protein level and is localized in the cytosol, mid piece, principal piece, end piece, and annulus. The gene is expressed in all tissues and is particularly associated with neuronal and synaptic functions in the brain. It is also expressed in spermatocytes and spermatogonia, playing a role in spermatogenesis. The gene is part of the non-specific mitochondrial translation cluster in blood and is involved in gene expression regulation in cell lines.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 5 experiments, [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 5 experiments, [SREBF2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6721) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments, and [KLF5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/688) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, pituitary, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), CD105+ endothelial cells, the amygdala, and testis germ cells.


The input data highlights pathways involved in metabolism, specifically focusing on the metabolism of nucleotides. Within this broader category, the data emphasizes purine metabolism, with a particular focus on purine salvage.


The mouse ortholog gene 15452 and its human ortholog gene 3251 are associated with the phenotype of abnormal gait, observed in both sexes.
