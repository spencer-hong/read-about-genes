The gene length is 1,113,268.0 base pairs (99.69% of all genes), the mature length is 1,632.0 base pairs (42.02% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 896,885.0 base pairs (99.85% of all genes).


The gene HEPH, with NCBI ID 9843, has been the subject of [35 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22HEPH%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1989, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2005 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning HEPH, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Cancer-associated fibroblast-derived exosomal microRNA-24-3p enhances colon cancer cell resistance to MTX by down-regulating CDX2/HEPH axis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33621425)" (2021) with a relative citation ratio of 4.4, "[Intense excimer CPL of pyrenes linked to a quaternaphthyl.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29354827)" (2018) with a relative citation ratio of 2.34, "[Zwitterionic [4]helicene: a water-soluble and reversible pH-triggered ECD/CPL chiroptical switch in the UV and red spectral regions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27139039)" (2016) with a relative citation ratio of 2.29, "[Decreased hephaestin activity in the intestine of copper-deficient mice causes systemic iron deficiency.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16614410)" (2006) with a relative citation ratio of 2.22, and "[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer links membrane ferroportin, hephaestin but not ferroportin, amyloid precursor protein complex with iron efflux.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30647129)" (2019) with a relative citation ratio of 2.16. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, followed by [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), and [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), each with 3 experiments.


The transcription factor [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6830) was found to be regulating genes in 2 Perturb-seq experiments.





The mouse ortholog gene 15203 and its human ortholog 9843 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities, including abnormal heart and lymph node morphology, enlarged heart and lymph nodes, and increased circulating levels of aspartate transaminase and iron. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.3196 (55.73rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -34.55 (4.91st percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.998 (30.93rd percentile), with a propensity for secondary structures as follows: 28.15% helix (17.92nd percentile), 36.44% sheet (69.31st percentile), and 30.14% turn (64.81st percentile). The instability index is 37.11 (14.47th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.61 (20.73rd percentile). The protein has a length of 1158 amino acids (90.99th percentile) and a molecular weight of 130447.06 Da (91.2nd percentile).
