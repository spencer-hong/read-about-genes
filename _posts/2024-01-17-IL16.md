The gene length is 30,468 base pairs (53.12% of all genes), the mature length is 1,152 base pairs (27.57% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 27,584.5 base pairs (60.41% of all genes).


IL16 (Gene NCBI ID: 3603) has been mentioned in [326 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22IL16%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1981, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2001 and 2015.


The top five publications mentioning IL16, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Urine Proteomics and Renal Single-Cell Transcriptomics Implicate Interleukin-16 in Lupus Nephritis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34783463)" (2022) with a relative citation ratio of 6.76, "[Molecular and functional analysis of a lymphocyte chemoattractant factor: association of biologic function with CD4 expression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7910967)" (1994) with a relative citation ratio of 5.21, "[CD4-mediated stimulation of human eosinophils: lymphocyte chemoattractant factor and other CD4-binding ligands elicit eosinophil migration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1851800)" (1991) with a relative citation ratio of 5.09, "[HIV suppression by interleukin-16.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8524386)" (1995) with a relative citation ratio of 5.04, and "[Interleukin 16 and its function as a CD4 ligand.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8908813)" (1996) with a relative citation ratio of 4.9. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[IL16](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000172349-IL16) is a cytokine involved in cancer-related genes, with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is localized to nuclear speckles, the plasma membrane, and the cytosol. IL16 is expressed in neutrophils and is associated with protein binding. In lymphoid tissue, it is involved in cytokine signaling, and in lymphoma cell lines, it plays a role in the immune response. Additionally, IL16 is found in B-cells, where it contributes to B-cell function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 4 experiments, followed by [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 3 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as male reproductive organ cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are noted. Cardiovascular issues such as coronary artery disease, artery disease, and vascular disease are also present. Furthermore, the data highlights nervous system diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, and cognitive disorders. Mental health conditions, specifically attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, are also included.


Interleukin-16 (IL16) has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, IL16 levels have been linked to [Interleukin-16 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28240269), with the closest MeSH match being [Interleukin-16](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D019410) identified using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, IL16 has been implicated in [Primary biliary cholangitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28425483), which maps directly to the MeSH term [Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008105). Furthermore, IL16 is associated with [Protein levels in obesity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29234017), with the closest MeSH match being [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506), also identified using the BioWordVec method.


The gene is expressed in various immune-related tissues and cell types, including blood and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), whole blood, and tonsil, suggesting a ubiquitous expression in multiple tissue samples related to the immune system.
