The gene length is 623,082 base pairs (98.94% of all genes), the mature length is 571 base pairs (3.73% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 506,746 base pairs (99.28% of all genes).


The gene MTF1, with NCBI ID 4520, has been the subject of [72 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MTF1%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2018.


The top five publications mentioning MTF1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Cloned transcription factor MTF-1 activates the mouse metallothionein I promoter.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8467794)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 7.79), "[Zinc reduces hepatic lipid deposition and activates lipophagy via Zn<sup>2+</sup>/MTF-1/PPARα and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaMKKβ/AMPK pathways.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29912588)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 4.55), "[Understanding the mechanisms of zinc-sensing by metal-response element binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17462582)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 4.24), "[Activity of metal-responsive transcription factor 1 by toxic heavy metals and H2O2 in vitro is modulated by metallothionein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14612393)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 3.95), and "[Cloning, chromosomal mapping and characterization of the human metal-regulatory transcription factor MTF-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8065932)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 3.77). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 6 experiments, followed by [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each with 5 experiments.





The gene MTF1 has been associated with [FVC](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36641522), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Peak Expiratory Flow Rate](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D010366) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The mouse ortholog gene 17764 and its human ortholog gene 4520 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal craniofacial morphology, abnormal embryo size, abnormal forebrain morphology, anophthalmia, embryonic growth retardation, and microphthalmia. Additionally, there is preweaning lethality with complete penetrance in both sexes. Notably, prenatal lethality prior to heart atrial septation is observed, although this phenotype is not present in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.5114 (33.82nd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of -33.21 at pH 7.0 (5.26th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.0084 (76.47th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 27.36% helix (13.64th percentile), 29.35% sheet (24.97th percentile), and 35.33% turn (90.13th percentile). The instability index is 63.10 (87.94th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 5.14 (10.4th percentile). The sequence length is 753 amino acids (78.38th percentile), and the molecular weight is 80956.02 Da (76.82nd percentile).
