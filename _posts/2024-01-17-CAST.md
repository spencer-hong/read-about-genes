The gene enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723), [endopeptidase inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004866), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010859). It is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and located in the [endoplasmic reticulum](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005783), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), and [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). Additionally, it enables [cadherin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045296) and is involved in the [inhibition of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097340), [presynaptic active zone organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990709), and [negative regulation of type B pancreatic cell apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:2000675).


The gene length is 9,526 base pairs (24.79% of all genes), the mature length is 1,883 base pairs (49.64% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 9,207 base pairs (31.15% of all genes).


The gene CAST (NCBI ID: 831) has been mentioned in [395 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CAST%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1911, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning CAST, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[CASTp: computed atlas of surface topography of proteins with structural and topographical mapping of functionally annotated residues.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16844972)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 29.6), "[Update from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34346716)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 14.08), "[EUCAST Definitive Document E.Def 1.2, May 2000: Terminology relating to methods for the determination of susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11168186)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 6.99), "[Molecular mechanisms of acquired antifungal drug resistance in principal fungal pathogens and EUCAST guidance for their laboratory detection and clinical implications.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35703391)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 6.97), and "[Quantitative evaluation of chromosomal rearrangements in gene-edited human stem cells by CAST-Seq.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33626327)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 5.91). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CAST](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000153113-CAST) is a gene that functions as a protease inhibitor, specifically a thiol protease inhibitor. It is implicated in cancer-related genes and palmoplantar keratoderma, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and cytosol. CAST is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 38 in monocytes and neutrophils related to degranulation, Cluster 19 in non-specific basic cellular processes, Cluster 49 in the hindbrain with mixed functions, Cluster 53 in squamous epithelial cells involved in keratinization, and Cluster 21 in early spermatids related to spermatogenesis.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) and [CREB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1385), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [SMARCB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6598), and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as hematologic cancer, immune system cancer, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Metabolic disorders are also prominent, with links to diabetes mellitus, specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus, and carbohydrate metabolism diseases. Cardiovascular issues are represented by associations with artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, and hypertension. Neurological conditions include neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, cognitive disorder, and Parkinson's disease, as well as motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Additionally, the data highlights associations with kidney disease, urinary system disease, bone inflammation disease, connective tissue disease, musculoskeletal system disease, integumentary system disease, and specific conditions like psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.


The genome-wide association study identified [Protein quantitative trait loci (liver)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32778093) as a significant trait, which was mapped to the closest existing MeSH term [Genes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005796) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in muscle and vagina tissue samples according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in CD33+ Myeloid cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD14+ Monocytes, CD105+ Endothelial cells, and CD71+ Early Erythroid cells.



The mouse ortholog gene 12380 and its human ortholog gene 831 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal digit morphology, abnormal gait, decreased startle reflex, and increased heart weight. Additionally, abnormal nail morphology is observed, although it is not specified to affect both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -1.193 (1.85th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -32.75 (5.4th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.032 (99.56th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (42.37%, 96.41st percentile) and turns (35.59%, 90.83rd percentile), with a lower affinity for sheet structures (20.48%, 2.41st percentile). The instability index is 49.83 (56.67th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 4.98 (7.31st percentile). The protein is 708 amino acids long (75.79th percentile) with a molecular weight of 76571.93 Da (74.47th percentile).
