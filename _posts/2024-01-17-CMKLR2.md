The gene enables [G protein-coupled receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004930) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), as well as [neuropeptide binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042923), [adipokinetic hormone receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097003), and [adipokinetic hormone binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097004). It is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and [intracellular membrane-bounded organelle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043231), and is active in the [neuron projection](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043005). The gene is involved in the [G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007186), [neuropeptide signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007218), and [glucose homeostasis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042593).


The gene length is 41,742 base pairs (61.43% of all genes), the mature length is 9,407 base pairs (98.74% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 41,741 base pairs (71.02% of all genes).


The gene CMKLR2 (NCBI ID: 2825) has been mentioned in [21 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CMKLR2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1982, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2005 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning CMKLR2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Signaling Properties of Chemerin Receptors CMKLR1, GPR1 and CCRL2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27716822)" (2016) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 4.67, "[CMKLR1 and GPR1 mediate chemerin signaling through the RhoA/ROCK pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26363224)" (2015) with an RCR of 2.47, "[Use of GPR1, GPR15, and STRL33 as coreceptors by diverse human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus envelope proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9791028)" (1998) with an RCR of 2.38, "[GPER-1 and estrogen receptor-Î² ligands modulate aldosterone synthesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25167221)" (2014) with an RCR of 1.96, and "[The role of GPR1 signaling in mice corpus luteum.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27149986)" (2016) with an RCR of 1.65. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CMKLR2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000183671-CMKLR2) is a G-protein coupled receptor with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, vesicles, and plasma membrane. CMKLR2 is highly expressed in the choroid plexus, where it is involved in transmembrane transport. In the brain, it is also associated with mixed functions in the choroid plexus. Additionally, CMKLR2 is expressed in connective tissue cells and fibroblasts, contributing to extracellular matrix organization. The gene is unprognostic for Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma (validation), and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 5 experiments, [NANOG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79923) with 4 experiments, [SS18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6760) with 3 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 3 experiments, and [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 3 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including several types of cancer such as lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, as well as metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Additionally, there are links to cardiovascular system diseases and general diseases of cellular proliferation and anatomical entities.


The gene CMKLR2 has been associated with [Educational attainment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855049), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Educational Status](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004522) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the vagina, skin, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Adrenal Cortex, Appendix, Superior Cervical Ganglion, Trigeminal Ganglion, Atrioventricular Node, Ciliary Ganglion, Skin, and Dorsal Root Ganglion.
