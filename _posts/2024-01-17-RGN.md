The gene length is 5,092 base pairs (14.23% of all genes), the mature length is 918 base pairs (18.94% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 5,067 base pairs (18.92% of all genes).


The gene RGN (NCBI ID: 9104) has been mentioned in [79 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RGN%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1955, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning RGN, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Kidney tissue proteomics reveals regucalcin downregulation in response to diabetic nephropathy with reflection in urinary exosomes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26072307)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 2.45), "[The gene of Ca2+-binding protein regucalcin is highly conserved in vertebrate species.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10891565)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 1.72), "[Regucalcin promotes dormancy of prostate cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33323968)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.72), "[Suppressive role of regucalcin in liver cell proliferation: involvement in carcinogenesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23692083)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.55), and "[Twelve Weeks of Whole Body Vibration Training Improve Regucalcin, Body Composition and Physical Fitness in Postmenopausal Women: A Pilot Study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32498351)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.49). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RGN](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130988-RGN) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The RGN gene product is primarily localized in the cytosol and is detected in many tissues. It is notably expressed in the liver, where it is involved in metabolism (Cluster 83), and in the brain, where it is associated with non-specific transcription processes (Cluster 25). In cell lines, RGN expression is clustered with liver cancer metabolism (Cluster 18), and in single cells, it is associated with proximal tubular cells involved in amino acid metabolism (Cluster 56). The gene is unprognostic for various cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [HNF4A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3172) with 3 experiments, [POU5F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5460) with 2 experiments, [RARA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5914) with 2 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 2 experiments, and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 2 experiments.





The gene is expressed in the liver and adrenal gland according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), liver, adrenal cortex, adrenal gland, kidney, and fetal liver.
