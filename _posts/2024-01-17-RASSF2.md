[RASSF2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000101265-RASSF2) is a tumor suppressor gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in the nucleoplasm, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 38 in monocytes and neutrophils related to degranulation, Cluster 9 in oligodendrocytes related to myelination, Cluster 30 in white matter related to myelination, Cluster 55 in lymphoma related to immune response, and Cluster 74 in neutrophils related to degranulation.
