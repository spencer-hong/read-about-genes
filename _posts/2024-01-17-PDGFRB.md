The gene PDGFRB (NCBI ID: 5159) has been mentioned in [631 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PDGFRB%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1986, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2018.


The top five publications mentioning PDGFRB, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Stimulatory autoantibodies to the PDGF receptor in systemic sclerosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16790699)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 10.06), "[Response to imatinib mesylate in patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases with rearrangements of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12181402)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 9.32), "[CGP 57148, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibits the growth of cells expressing BCR-ABL, TEL-ABL, and TEL-PDGFR fusion proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9389713)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 9.14), "[SU11248 inhibits KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta in preclinical models of human small cell lung cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12748309)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 8.86), and "[PdgfrÎ²+ Mural Preadipocytes Contribute to Adipocyte Hyperplasia Induced by High-Fat-Diet Feeding and Prolonged Cold Exposure in Adult Mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26626462)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 8.17). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PDGFRB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000113721-PDGFRB) is a developmental protein with kinase, receptor, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase molecular functions. It is implicated in various cancer-related processes, serving as a proto-oncogene and a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence supports its role at the protein level. PDGFRB is detected in many tissues and is localized to the Golgi apparatus and vesicles. Its expression is associated with non-specific ATP binding in blood, adipose tissue-related functions, choroid plexus-related functions in the brain, ECM organization in connective tissue cells, and signal transduction in smooth muscle cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each with 5 experiments, followed by [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 5 experiments, [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113) with 4 experiments, and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 4 experiments.

PDGFRB has been associated with several traits through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to the [Granulocyte percentage of myeloid white cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863252), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Granulocyte Precursor Cells](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D042381) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, PDGFRB is associated with the [Monocyte percentage of white cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863252), corresponding to the MeSH term [Monocytes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D009000). Furthermore, it has been implicated in [Retinal arteriolar tortuosity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36757925), which maps to the MeSH term [Retinaldehyde](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012172). These associations highlight the diverse roles of PDGFRB in various biological processes.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the retina, adipocytes, lung, fetal thyroid, uterus corpus, fetal lung, and uterus.


The input data highlights various pathways involved in immune system function, including adaptive and innate immune systems. Additionally, it emphasizes multiple signaling pathways, particularly those involving PI3K/AKT, such as constitutive PI3K/AKT signaling in cancer, PI3K events in ERBB2 and ERBB4 signaling, and PIP3 activation of AKT signaling. Other notable pathways include signaling by various receptors like SCF-KIT, ERBB4, PDGF, FGFR, and EGFR, as well as downstream signal transduction events. The data also covers signaling related to NGF, Fc epsilon receptor (FCERI), and B Cell Receptor (BCR), along with general disease and signal transduction processes.


The mouse ortholog gene 18596 and its human ortholog gene 5159 are associated with several phenotypes. Notably, abnormal seminal vesicle morphology is observed, although this phenotype is not present in both sexes. Additionally, both sexes exhibit enlarged heart and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance.
