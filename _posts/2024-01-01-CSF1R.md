The gene CSF1R (NCBI ID: 1436) has been featured in [571 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CSF1R%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1957, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1996 and 2019.


The top five publications mentioning CSF1R, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[CSF-1R inhibition alters macrophage polarization and blocks glioma progression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24056773)" (2013) with a relative citation ratio of 43.47. Following this, "[Targeting tumor-associated macrophages with anti-CSF-1R antibody reveals a strategy for cancer therapy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24898549)" (2014) has a relative citation ratio of 26.6. Additionally, "[CSF1/CSF1R blockade reprograms tumor-infiltrating macrophages and improves response to T-cell checkpoint immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer models.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25082815)" (2014) has a relative citation ratio of 24.87. Another notable publication is "[Gr-1+CD115+ immature myeloid suppressor cells mediate the development of tumor-induced T regulatory cells and T-cell anergy in tumor-bearing host.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16424049)" (2006) with a relative citation ratio of 20.55. Lastly, "[Microglial Depletion with CSF1R Inhibitor during Chronic Phase of Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury Reduces Neurodegeneration and Neurological Deficits.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32094203)" (2020) has a relative citation ratio of 13.58.

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 5 experiments, [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) with 4 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 4 experiments, and [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The CSF1R gene has been associated with [serum total protein levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Serum](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D044967) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The mouse ortholog gene 12978 and its human ortholog gene 1436 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.2077 (68.37th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -15.14 (15.2nd percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.998 (32.64th percentile), with a secondary structure composition of 29.01% helix (23.64th percentile), 36.83% sheet (71.94th percentile), and 30.56% turn (67.8th percentile). The instability index is 43.32 (33.34th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.93 (28.73rd percentile). The protein has a length of 972 amino acids (86.83rd percentile) and a molecular weight of 107982.49 Da (86.78th percentile).
