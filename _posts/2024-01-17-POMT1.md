Additionally, it enables [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872).


The gene length is 50,592.0 base pairs (66.71 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 7,057.0 base pairs (96.58 percentile of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 50,592.0 base pairs (75.53 percentile of all genes).


The gene POMT1 (NCBI ID: 10585) has been mentioned in [37 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POMT1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1999 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2005 and 2014. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning POMT1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mutations in the O-mannosyltransferase gene POMT1 give rise to the severe neuronal migration disorder Walker-Warburg syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12369018)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 9.69), "[Demonstration of mammalian protein O-mannosyltransferase activity: coexpression of POMT1 and POMT2 required for enzymatic activity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14699049)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 5.46), "[An autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2) with mild mental retardation is allelic to Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) caused by a mutation in the POMT1 gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15792865)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 2.65), "[Targeted disruption of the Walker-Warburg syndrome gene Pomt1 in mouse results in embryonic lethality.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15383666)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 2.21), and "[Enhanced influenza A H1N1 T cell epitope recognition and cross-reactivity to protein-O-mannosyltransferase 1 in Pandemrix-associated narcolepsy type 1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33863907)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.96). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[POMT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130714-POMT1) is a gene encoding a protein with glycosyltransferase and transferase molecular functions. It is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus and is detected in all tissues at the RNA level. The gene is associated with several diseases, including congenital muscular dystrophy, dystroglycanopathy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and lissencephaly. Evidence for its involvement in these conditions is supported at the protein level. POMT1 exhibits specific expression patterns, being highly expressed in testis tissue related to transcription, forebrain regions with mixed functions, and spermatocytes and spermatids involved in spermatid development.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [OLIG2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10215), [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, brain, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD8+ T cells, fetal brain, and multiple testicular tissues, including interstitial, Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and germ cells.




The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.188, indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature (90.22nd percentile). It exhibits a charge of 10.19 at pH 7.0 (81.86th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.983 (6.25th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 29.6% helix (28.31st percentile), 42.4% sheet (91.49th percentile), and 25.7% turn (26.77th percentile). The instability index is 51.11 (60.76th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.69 (70.79th percentile). The protein has a length of 747 amino acids (78.08th percentile) and a molecular weight of 84879.65 Da (78.73rd percentile).
