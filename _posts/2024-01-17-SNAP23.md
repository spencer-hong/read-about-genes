[SNAP23](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000092531-SNAP23) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized to the plasma membrane and primary cilium. The gene is expressed in neutrophils and is involved in protein binding. In lymphoid tissue, it plays a role in immune response, while in the brain's white matter, it is involved in signal transduction. Additionally, SNAP23 is expressed in various cell lines and single cells, including platelets, where it contributes to hemostasis.
