The gene is located in the [Golgi membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000139), [endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005793), [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), [Golgi stack](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005795), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), and [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). It is active in the [endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005793) and [cis-Golgi network](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005801). The gene enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [sequence-specific DNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043565).

[GOLGB1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000173230-GOLGB1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 30 for blood expression, Cluster 49 for tissue expression in the pituitary gland, Cluster 36 for brain expression in the choroid plexus, Cluster 63 for cell line expression, and Cluster 55 for single cell expression. Notably, GOLGB1 is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and others, as indicated by the TCGA and validation studies.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [9126](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126), which was shown to regulate genes in 3 experiments, [9968](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) in 2 experiments, and [8861](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861) in 1 experiment. These findings highlight the regulatory roles of these TFs in gene expression changes as observed in Perturb-seq studies.


The input data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are noted. The data also encompasses hematopoietic and immune system diseases, as well as cardiovascular system disease. Furthermore, musculoskeletal system diseases, including bone remodeling and resorption diseases, are highlighted.


The GOLGB1 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Calcium levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Calcium](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D002118) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, GOLGB1 is associated with [Mean corpuscular hemoglobin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888493) and [Mean corpuscular volume](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888493), both of which are direct synonym matches to the MeSH term [Erythrocyte Indices](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004909). Furthermore, the gene is linked to [Serum phosphate levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Phosphates](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D010710) using the BioWordVec method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid, prostate, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), CD34+ cells, salivary gland, pituitary, and ovary.
