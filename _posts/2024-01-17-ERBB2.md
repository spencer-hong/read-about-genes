The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [positive regulation of protein phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001934), [protein phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006468), and [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165). It enables several molecular functions such as [protein tyrosine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004713), [transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004714), and [transmembrane signaling receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004888). The gene is located in multiple cellular components, including the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), [early endosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005769), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). Additionally, it is part of the [semaphorin receptor complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002116) and contributes to various developmental processes such as [multicellular organism development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007275), [heart development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007507), and [neuromuscular junction development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007528).


The gene length is 49,660 base pairs (66.1% of all genes), the mature length is 1,969 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 49,419 base pairs.


The gene ERBB2 (NCBI ID: 2064) has been mentioned in [14,022 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ERBB2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning ERBB2 is 1968, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning ERBB2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human breast cancer: correlation of relapse and survival with amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3798106)" (1987) (relative citation ratio: 227.0), "[Studies of the HER-2/neu proto-oncogene in human breast and ovarian cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2470152)" (1989) (relative citation ratio: 146.06), "[Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (ToGA): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20728210)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 129.69), "[Recommendations for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists clinical practice guideline update.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24101045)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 99.09), and "[Trastuzumab plus adjuvant chemotherapy for operable HER2-positive breast cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16236738)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 82.95). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[ERBB2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141736-ERBB2) is a gene with multiple molecular functions, including activator, kinase, receptor, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase. It is involved in cancer-related processes and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. The gene's expression is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, and cytosol. ERBB2 is part of various expression clusters, including those related to the parathyroid gland, astrocytes, breast cancer cell lines, and respiratory epithelial cells. Evidence for ERBB2 is available at the protein level.
