The gene length is 7,111 base pairs (19.26% of all genes), the mature length is 396 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 396 base pairs.


The gene PON2, with NCBI ID 5445, has been the subject of [111 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PON2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2018.


The top five publications mentioning PON2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human paraoxonases (PON1, PON2, and PON3) are lactonases with overlapping and distinct substrate specificities.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15772423)" (2005) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 12.51, "[Paraoxonase-2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein with antioxidant properties and is capable of preventing cell-mediated oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11579088)" (2001) with an RCR of 8.18, "[DNA polymorphisms in two paraoxonase genes (PON1 and PON2) are associated with the risk of coronary heart disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9443862)" (1998) with an RCR of 5.2, "[Paraoxonase-2 reduces oxidative stress in vascular cells and decreases endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced caspase activation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17404154)" (2007) with an RCR of 4.53, and "[Paraoxonase-2: A potential biomarker for skin cancer aggressiveness.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33210737)" (2021) with an RCR of 3.59. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [CEBPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1050) was found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The PON2 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Apolipoprotein A1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32203549), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Apolipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001053) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, PON2 is associated with [HDL cholesterol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594039), which directly matches the MeSH term [Cholesterol, HDL](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008076).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.039 (81.98th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -15.16 (15.15th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.995 (20.59th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 32.20% (52.24th percentile), 40.40% (87.42nd percentile), and 31.36% (72.95th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 28.35 (2.88th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 5.33 (14.22nd percentile). The protein is 354 amino acids long (38.72nd percentile) and has a molecular weight of 39380.42 Da (38.61st percentile).
