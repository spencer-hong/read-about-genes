[GOT2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000125166-GOT2) is a gene with aminotransferase and transferase molecular functions. It is involved in cancer-related genes and is a disease variant associated with epilepsy. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 13 in blood, Cluster 23 in tissue, Cluster 23 in the brain, Cluster 68 in cell lines, and Cluster 68 in single cells, indicating its role in mitochondria, cellular respiration, cell cycle regulation, and muscle contraction.

The GOT2 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [imidazole lactate levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36357675), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Lactic Acid](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D019344) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, GOT2 is associated with [metabolite levels (imidazole lactate; imidazolelactate)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37253714) and [metabolite levels (phenyllactate (PLA); phenyllactate)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37253714), both of which map to the MeSH term [Metabolome](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D055442). Furthermore, it is linked to [phenyllactate (pla) levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36357675), mapping to the MeSH term [Isoleucine](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007532), and [serum metabolite levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33031748), which maps to the MeSH term [Serum](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D044967).


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, muscle, and liver, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the liver, B lymphoblasts (721_B), promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), and Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Daudi).


The input data highlights several pathways related to metabolism, including the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and their derivatives, gluconeogenesis, and glucose metabolism. Additionally, it includes pathways associated with specific conditions such as myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora, glycogen storage diseases, and general disease processes.


The mouse ortholog gene 14719, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 2806, is associated with various abnormal phenotypes observed in both sexes, including abnormal blood vessel morphology, abnormal embryo turning, abnormal forebrain development, abnormal heart morphology, abnormal hindbrain development, abnormal midbrain development, abnormal neural tube closure, abnormal neural tube morphology, abnormal pharyngeal arch morphology, abnormal visceral yolk sac morphology, abnormal vitelline vasculature morphology, embryonic growth retardation, enlarged cecum, enlarged spleen, hemorrhage, preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, small kidney, and small spleen. Additionally, prenatal lethality prior to heart atrial septation was observed, although this phenotype was not present in both sexes.
