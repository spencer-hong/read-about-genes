[COPA](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000122218-COPA) is a gene with a molecular function related to hormones and is implicated in disease variants. Evidence for its involvement is supported at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and cytosol. COPA is part of blood expression cluster 10, which is associated with non-specific membrane trafficking, and tissue expression cluster 65, linked to cerebellum and nervous system development. Additionally, it is found in brain expression cluster 27, cell line expression cluster 45, and single cell expression cluster 28, which are involved in mixed function, nuclear processes, and antigen presentation in dendritic cells, respectively.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [CHD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1105), [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942), and [IKZF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10320) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.


The transcription factors [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8243) and [ZNF274](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) were each found to be regulating genes in one Perturb-seq experiment, according to data from GTRD's database of transcription factor binding sites and the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).


The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cardiovascular system disease, nervous system disease, central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, cognitive disorder, and disease of mental health.
