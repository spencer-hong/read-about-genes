Additionally, it is involved in [brain development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007420), [tissue regeneration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042246), and various regulatory processes such as [negative regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010642) and [negative regulation of lipoprotein lipid oxidation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060588).


The gene length is 9,395 base pairs (24.45th percentile), the mature length is 1,500 base pairs (37.98th percentile), and the primary transcript length is 9,395 base pairs (31.65th percentile).


APOD (Gene ID: 347) has been mentioned in [171 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22APOD%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning APOD was in 1963, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1995 and 2012.


The top five publications mentioning APOD, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include: "[Reduction of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, apolipoprotein D and the Lp(a) lipoprotein with the anabolic steroid stanozolol.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6236850)" (1984) (relative citation ratio: 7.82), "[Studies on the isolation and partial characterization of apolipoprotein D and lipoprotein D of human plasma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/56198)" (1976) (relative citation ratio: 5.64), "[Apolipoprotein D.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11058760)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 5.33), "[Cloning and expression of human apolipoprotein D cDNA.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3453108)" (1986) (relative citation ratio: 5.04), and "[Isolation and partial characterization of apolipoprotein D: a new protein moiety of the human plasma lipoprotein system.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4128506)" (1973) (relative citation ratio: 4.17). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[APOD](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000189058-APOD) is a gene involved in cancer-related processes, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized to the plasma membrane. APOD is expressed in B-cells, particularly those involved in immunoglobulin production, and is highly expressed in the choroid plexus, where it plays a role in transmembrane transport. In the brain, APOD is associated with white matter and myelination processes. Additionally, it is expressed in connective tissue cells and fibroblasts, contributing to the organization of the extracellular matrix.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various neural tissues, including the trigeminal ganglion, atrioventricular node, dorsal root ganglion, and olfactory bulb.


The proteins are involved in various transmembrane transport processes, including slc-mediated transport, transport of small molecules, orphan transporters, transport of fatty acids, and transport of vitamins, nucleosides, and related molecules.
