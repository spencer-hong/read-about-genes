It enables [guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005085), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [lipid binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008289). The gene is involved in [vesicle-mediated transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016192), [regulation of ARF protein signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032012), and [establishment of epithelial cell polarity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0090162). Additionally, it acts upstream of or within the [regulation of cell adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030155).


The gene length is 9,607 base pairs (24.92% of all genes), the mature length is 2,859.5 base pairs (70.29% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 6,246 base pairs (22.8% of all genes).


The gene CYTH1, with NCBI ID 9267, has been mentioned in [88 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CYTH1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1978, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2014. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning CYTH1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A human exchange factor for ARF contains Sec7- and pleckstrin-homology domains.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8945478)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 6.94), "[Alpha L beta 2 integrin/LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 induced by cytohesin-1, a cytoplasmic regulatory molecule.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8706128)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 6.84), "[Turning on ARF: the Sec7 family of guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10652516)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 5.96), "[Regulation of Arf activation: the Sec7 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17850229)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 4.99), and "[EFA6, a sec7 domain-containing exchange factor for ARF6, coordinates membrane recycling and actin cytoskeleton organization.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10075920)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 3.81). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CYTH1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000108669-CYTH1) is a gene that functions as a guanine-nucleotide releasing factor, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is notably expressed in oligodendrocytes, contributing to myelination. In the brain, it is associated with white matter and signal transduction. Additionally, CYTH1 is expressed in lymphoma cell lines, NK-cells, and T-cells, playing roles in the immune system and transcription. Its expression in blood is non-specific and related to cell proliferation.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and tauopathy. Additionally, it highlights connections to cognitive disorders, dementia, and diseases of mental health. Furthermore, the data points to musculoskeletal system diseases, specifically muscular diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including blood, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), whole blood, and prostate.
