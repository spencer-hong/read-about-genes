The gene has a length of 737,388 base pairs (99.21% of all genes), a mature length of 788 base pairs (13.3% of all genes), and a primary transcript length of 455,135 base pairs (99.11% of all genes).


The gene GIPR (NCBI ID: 2696) has been the subject of [74 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GIPR%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2020.


The top five publications mentioning GIPR, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Genetic variation in GIPR influences the glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose challenge.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20081857)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 11.4, "[Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor, a member of the secretin-vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor family, is widely distributed in peripheral organs and the brain.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8243312)" (1993) with a relative citation ratio of 10.7, "[Optimized GIP analogs promote body weight lowering in mice through GIPR agonism not antagonism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30578168)" (2019) with a relative citation ratio of 6.8, "[GIPR agonism mediates weight-independent insulin sensitization by tirzepatide in obese mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34003802)" (2021) with a relative citation ratio of 6.57, and "[Targeting the GIPR for obesity: To agonize or antagonize? Potential mechanisms.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33290902)" (2021) with a relative citation ratio of 5.25. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [G-protein coupled receptor](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) functions as a receptor and transducer, with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in vesicles. The gene is expressed in specific clusters, including Cluster 39 in the retina and testis, associated with cilium function, and Cluster 26 in oligodendrocytes with mixed functions in the brain. Additionally, it is found in Cluster 16 in thyroid cancer cell lines, linked to neuronal signaling, and Cluster 42 in ciliated cells, involved in cilium assembly.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), [PBX3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5090), and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.





The GIPR gene has been associated with various traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Body fat percentage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30593698) with the closest MeSH match being [Adiposity](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D050154), identified using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, GIPR is associated with [Body mass index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28448500) with a direct canonical name match to [Body Mass Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015992). Other associations include [Body size at age 10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32376654) with an embedding match to [Time](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013995), and various glucose-related traits such as [GIP levels in response to oral glucose tolerance test](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29093273) with an embedding match to [Glucose](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005947). Furthermore, GIPR is linked to [Hip circumference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36329257) with an embedding match to [Hip](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006615), [Obesity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23563607) with a direct canonical name match to [Obesity](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D009765), [Pulse pressure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230300) with a synonym direct match to [Blood Pressure](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001794), and [Waist circumference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31453325) with a direct canonical name match to [Waist Circumference](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D055105). These findings highlight the multifaceted role of GIPR in various physiological processes and diseases.


The mouse ortholog gene 381853 and its human ortholog gene 2696 are associated with the phenotype of impaired righting response, observed in both sexes.
