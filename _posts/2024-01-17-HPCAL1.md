The gene enables [calcium ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005509) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is located in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020).


The gene length is 38,410 base pairs (59.34% of all genes), the mature length is 4,912 base pairs (89.87% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 31,375.5 base pairs (63.75% of all genes).


The gene HPCAL1 (NCBI ID: 3241) has been mentioned in [11 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22HPCAL1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2000 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2007 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning HPCAL1 include "[Hippocalcin-like 1 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma progression by promoting p21(Waf/Cip1) stabilization by activating the ERK1/2-MAPK pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26659654)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 1.51), "[Hippocalcin-like 1 is a key regulator of LDHA activation that promotes the growth of non-small cell lung carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35102488)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 1.47), "[The visinin-like proteins VILIP-1 and VILIP-3 in Alzheimer's disease-old wine in new bottles.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22375104)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 1.3), "[The neuronal EF-hand calcium-binding protein visinin-like protein-3 is expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and shows a calcium-dependent membrane association.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10683417)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 0.89), and "[Evidence for different functional properties of the neuronal calcium sensor proteins VILIP-1 and VILIP-3: from subcellular localization to cellular function.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12445467)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 0.67). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[HPCAL1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000115756-HPCAL1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the cerebellum, contributing to nervous system development. In the brain, it is expressed in neurons with mixed functions. Additionally, HPCAL1 is found in skin cancer cell lines involved in extracellular matrix organization and in intestinal goblet cells responsible for mucin production. In blood, it is part of the non-specific innate immune response cluster.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, as well as hematopoietic and immune system diseases. Additionally, the data highlights associations with cardiovascular system diseases, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and vascular disease. Neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and cognitive disorders are also represented. Furthermore, the data includes associations with musculoskeletal system diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic disorders such as lipid storage disease, and hematological conditions like anemia. Gastrointestinal system diseases, including biliary tract disease and cholestasis, are also noted.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus, brain, and lung, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (night), prefrontal cortex, amygdala, whole brain, cerebellum, cerebellum peduncles, and lung.
