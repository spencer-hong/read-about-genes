[KCNJ16](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000153822-KCNJ16) is a gene encoding a protein with molecular functions as an ion channel and voltage-gated channel. It is involved in diseases such as deafness and has evidence at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the kidney, specifically in proximal tubular cells, where it plays a role in transmembrane transport. Subcellularly, the protein is located in vesicles. In the brain, KCNJ16 is expressed in astrocytes with mixed functions. Additionally, the gene is expressed in kidney cancer cell lines, particularly in membrane components. While KCNJ16 is unprognostic for several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, its expression patterns highlight its potential significance in various biological contexts.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) were found to be regulating in 2 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as carbohydrate and glucose metabolism diseases. Additionally, the data highlights links to nervous system diseases, specifically neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, associations with gastrointestinal system diseases, including periodontitis and periodontal disease, are also noted.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the thyroid, hypothalamus, spinal cord, cerebellum, pancreatic islet, fetal thyroid, and kidney.


The input data highlights various pathways involving potassium channels, including the activation of G protein gated potassium channels and inwardly rectifying K+ channels. Additionally, it covers the inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels via Gbeta/gamma subunits and the activation of GABAB receptors. The data also encompasses broader processes such as GABA receptor activation, potassium transport channels, and transmission across chemical synapses within the neuronal system.


The mouse ortholog gene 16517 and its human ortholog gene 3773 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal bone mineralization, abnormal bone structure, increased bone mineral content, and tremors. Notably, abnormal bone mineralization is not observed in both sexes, while the other phenotypes are present in both sexes.
