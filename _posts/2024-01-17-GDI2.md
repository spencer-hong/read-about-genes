The gene length is 10,930 base pairs (27.53% of all genes), the mature length is 4,065 base pairs (84.28% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 8,097 base pairs (28.17% of all genes).


The gene GDI2 (NCBI ID: 2665) has been mentioned in [8 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GDI2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1999 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2006 and 2020. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning GDI2, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Proteomic identification of paclitaxel-resistance associated hnRNP A2 and GDI 2 proteins in human ovarian cancer cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20858016)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 1.2), "[Spin filtering effect, thermal spin diode effect and high tunneling magnetoresistance in the Au/GdI<sub>2</sub>/Au van der Waals junction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35587036)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 0.94), "[<i>GDI2</i> is a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894398)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.74), "[General role of GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 in membrane release of Rab proteins: modulations of its functional interactions by in vitro and in vivo structural modifications.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10512627)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 0.62), and "[MicroRNA‑15b‑5p exerts its tumor repressive role via targeting GDI2: A novel insight into the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32945458)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.42). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GDI2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000057608-GDI2) is a gene involved in GTPase activation, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the plasma membrane and cytosol. The gene is notably expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, particularly in the context of degranulation, and is associated with liver plasma proteins. Additionally, GDI2 is involved in white matter myelination and is expressed in Langerhans cells, contributing to the innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088) and [EGR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1958), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), and [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, hypertension, and broader categories such as disease and disease of anatomical entity.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, adrenal gland, and spleen. Additionally, it is expressed in specific cell types and conditions such as 721_B_lymphoblasts, BDCA4+_DentriticCells, Leukemia_chronicMyelogenousK-562, Lymphoma_burkitts(Daudi), and Tonsil.


The proteins are involved in the Rho GTPase cycle, signaling by Rho GTPases, and signal transduction pathways.


The mouse ortholog gene 14569 and its human ortholog gene 2665 are associated with abnormal lens morphology and abnormal retina morphology, with these phenotypes observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.332 (54.15th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -3.08 (39.39th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.002 (48.98th percentile), with a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 31.01% (41.17th percentile), 38.65% (81.66th percentile), and 27.64% (44.06th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 34.71 (9.62nd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.11 (33.36th percentile). The protein has a length of 445 amino acids (51.3th percentile) and a molecular weight of 50662.66 Da (52.46th percentile).
