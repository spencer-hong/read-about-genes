It also enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524). The gene is active in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and is involved in [phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016310), [peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0018108), and [regulation of RNA splicing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043484). Additionally, it enables [protein serine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0106310).


The gene length is 19,848 base pairs (41.89% of all genes), the mature length is 626 base pairs (6.51% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 15,789 base pairs (45.44% of all genes).


The gene CLK1 (NCBI ID: 1195) has been mentioned in [52 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CLK1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1991 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2009 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning CLK1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The Clk/Sty protein kinase phosphorylates SR splicing factors and regulates their intranuclear distribution.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8617202)" (1996) with a relative citation ratio of 7.65, "[Collectin 11 (CL-11, CL-K1) is a MASP-1/3-associated plasma collectin with microbial-binding activity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20956340)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 4.08, "[Specific CLK inhibitors from a novel chemotype for regulation of alternative splicing.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21276940)" (2011) with a relative citation ratio of 4.07, "[SRPK1 and Clk/Sty protein kinases show distinct substrate specificities for serine/arginine-rich splicing factors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8798720)" (1996) with a relative citation ratio of 2.92, and "[Interplay between SRPK and Clk/Sty kinases in phosphorylation of the splicing factor ASF/SF2 is regulated by a docking motif in ASF/SF2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16209947)" (2005) with a relative citation ratio of 2.88. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CLK1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000013441-CLK1) is a kinase with serine/threonine-protein kinase, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase molecular functions. Evidence for this protein is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane. CLK1 is part of Cluster 21 in blood expression, which is associated with neutrophils but has an unknown function. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 40, which is non-specific and related to transcription. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 28, associated with oligodendrocytes and mixed function. In cell line expression, it is part of Cluster 26, which is non-specific and related to mitochondria and RNA binding. In single-cell expression, it is part of Cluster 80, which is non-specific and related to transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624), [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024), [ARID2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/196528), and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in nerve and ovary tissues.



The mouse ortholog gene 12747 and its human ortholog gene 1195 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal responses to tactile stimuli, decreased circulating calcium levels, increased circulating creatinine levels, and increased circulating phosphate levels. Additionally, a decrease in granulocyte number is observed, although this phenotype is not present in both sexes.
