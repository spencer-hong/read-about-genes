The gene enables [somatostatin receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004994) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). It is involved in the [G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007186), specifically the pathway coupled to cyclic nucleotide second messenger, as well as the [neuropeptide signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007218). Additionally, it plays a role in the [negative regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008285) and the [positive regulation of cytokinesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032467). The gene is also active in the [neuron projection](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043005) and is involved in the [somatostatin signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0038170), [regulation of insulin secretion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050796), and [cellular response to glucocorticoid stimulus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071385).


The gene length is 188,245 base pairs (91.76% of all genes), the mature length is 950.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 182,201 base pairs.


The gene SSTR5 (NCBI ID: 6755) has been mentioned in [92 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SSTR5%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1993 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2003 and 2015. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications in citations mentioning SSTR5 include "[Cloning, functional expression and pharmacological characterization of a fourth (hSSTR4) and a fifth (hSSTR5) human somatostatin receptor subtype.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8373420)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 7.67), "[Somatostatin receptor subtype specificity in human fetal pituitary cultures. Differential role of SSTR2 and SSTR5 for growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin regulation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9045884)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 7.44), "[The multi-ligand somatostatin analogue SOM230 inhibits ACTH secretion by cultured human corticotroph adenomas via somatostatin receptor type 5.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15817922)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 5.92), "[68Ga-DOTANOC: a first compound for PET imaging with high affinity for somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 5.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15551131)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 4.13), and "[Characterization of cloned somatostatin receptors SSTR4 and SSTR5.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8102785)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 3.84). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SSTR5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000162009-SSTR5) is a G-protein coupled receptor with evidence at the protein level, functioning as a receptor and transducer. It is an FDA-approved drug target and is detected in some tissues, primarily localized in the plasma membrane. SSTR5 is highly expressed in heart muscle and development (Cluster 30), hypothalamus with neuropeptide signaling (Cluster 56), and mucus-secreting cells (Cluster 2).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), [HNF4A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3172), and [TFAP2C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7022) were each found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuron disease, which are specific types of neurodegenerative diseases affecting the central nervous system.


SSTR5 has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [C-reactive protein levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35459240), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, SSTR5 is associated with [Heel bone mineral density](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30048462), corresponding to the MeSH term [Minerals](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008903). Furthermore, it is linked to [Insulin-like growth factor 1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), which maps to the MeSH term [Growth](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006128). Lastly, SSTR5 is associated with [Waist circumference adjusted for body mass index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31669095), aligning with the MeSH term [Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020481).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, pituitary, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland during both day and night, as well as in CD34+ cells, CD56+ NK cells, and the subthalamic nucleus.
