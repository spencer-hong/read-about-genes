The gene is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739) and specifically in the [mitochondrial inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005743). It is part of the [mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005753), including the coupling factor F(o) component. The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is involved in [proton motive force-driven ATP synthesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015986), [proton motive force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042776), and [proton transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902600). Additionally, it contributes to [proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, rotational mechanism](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046933) and is involved in [substantia nigra development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0021762).


The gene length is 96,653 base pairs (81.16% of all genes), the mature length is 2,082 base pairs (54.88% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 59,495 base pairs (79.19% of all genes).


The gene ATP5PF (NCBI ID: 522) has been mentioned in [29 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ATP5PF%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1983 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2003 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning ATP5PF are as follows: "[The function of Cav-1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell migration and invasion induced by ectopic ATP5B.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34009483)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.95), "[Mitochondrial coupling factor 6 is present on the surface of human vascular endothelial cells and is released by shear stress.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11748113)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 0.94), "[A novel inhibitory effect on prostacyclin synthesis of coupling factor 6 extracted from the heart of spontaneously hypertensive rats.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9822642)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 0.84), "[Involvement of FANCD2 in Energy Metabolism via ATP5Î±.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28687786)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 0.78), and "[Plasma concentration of coupling factor 6 and cardiovascular events in patients with end-stage renal disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14633154)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 0.62). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ATP5PF](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154723-ATP5PF) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the mitochondria, flagellar centriole, and end piece. The gene is associated with non-specific membrane trafficking in blood expression (Cluster 10), cellular respiration in tissue expression (Cluster 23), metabolism in brain expression (Cluster 21), leukemia-related hemostasis in cell line expression (Cluster 47), and muscle contraction in single-cell expression (Cluster 68).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [POU5F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5460) and [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [STAT5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6777), and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, muscle, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), colon, small intestine, adrenal gland, and testis.


The input data highlights several key metabolic processes, including the formation of ATP by chemiosmotic coupling, respiratory electron transport, and the citric acid (TCA) cycle. These processes are integral to cellular metabolism and energy production.
