The gene length is 402 base pairs (0.28 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 402 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 402 base pairs.


The gene POLR2E, with NCBI ID 5434, has been the subject of [20 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLR2E%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1995, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2018.


The top five publications mentioning POLR2E, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human RPB5, a subunit shared by eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases, binds human hepatitis B virus X protein and may play a role in X transactivation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7828586)" (1995) with a relative citation ratio of 4.22, "[Long noncoding RNAs POLR2E rs3787016 C/T and HULC rs7763881 A/C polymorphisms are associated with decreased risk of esophageal cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25874495)" (2015) with a relative citation ratio of 1.68, "[The prefoldin bud27 mediates the assembly of the eukaryotic RNA polymerases in an rpb5-dependent manner.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23459708)" (2013) with a relative citation ratio of 1.31, "[Analysis of URI nuclear interaction with RPB5 and components of the R2TP/prefoldin-like complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23667685)" (2013) with a relative citation ratio of 1.24, and "[The HOTAIR, PRNCR1 and POLR2E polymorphisms are associated with cancer risk: a meta-analysis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28159929)" (2017) with a relative citation ratio of 1.24. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) and [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [TCF12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6938), and [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





POLR2E has been associated with variations in [Lymphocyte count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888493), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Lymphocyte Count](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D018655). Additionally, it has been linked to [White blood cell count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888493), corresponding to the MeSH term [Leukocyte Count](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007958). These associations were identified using a method called [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.541 (30.92 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -4.12 (36.18 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.003 (56.43 percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix and sheet structures, with affinities of 0.329 (58.14 percentile) and 0.381 (79.03 percentile), respectively, and a lower tendency for turn structures at 0.195 (1.98 percentile). The instability index is 44.5 (37.44 percentile), with an isoelectric point of 5.69 (22.64 percentile). The protein is 210 amino acids long (16.0 percentile) and has a molecular weight of 24550.93 Da (17.4 percentile).
