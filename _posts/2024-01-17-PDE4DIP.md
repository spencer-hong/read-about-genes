The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [enzyme binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019899), and is involved in [molecular adaptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060090). It is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), [centrosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005813), and [myofibril](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030016). The gene is active in the [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794) and [centrosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005813), and is involved in the [centrosome cycle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007098), [protein-containing complex assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0065003), [positive regulation of microtubule nucleation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0090063), and [regulation of Golgi organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1903358).


The gene length is 26,267 base pairs (48.99% of all genes), the mature length is 857 base pairs (16.44% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 18,890 base pairs (50.14% of all genes).


The gene PDE4DIP has been mentioned in [10 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PDE4DIP%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2005, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning PDE4DIP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Recurrent homozygous deletion of DROSHA and microduplication of PDE4DIP in pineoblastoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30030436)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 1.9), "[Myomegalin is necessary for the formation of centrosomal and Golgi-derived microtubules.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23430395)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.39), "[A newly identified myomegalin isoform functions in Golgi microtubule organization and ER-Golgi transport.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25217626)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 1.2), "[Epistatic interaction of PDE4DIP and DES mutations in familial atrial fibrillation with slow conduction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34289528)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.96), and "[Serum anti-myomegalin antibodies in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17143517)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 0.94). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PDE4DIP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000178104-PDE4DIP) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 43 for non-specific transcription and translation in blood, Cluster 14 for skeletal muscle contraction in tissues, Cluster 15 for non-specific transcription in the brain, Cluster 71 for inflammatory response in lymphoma cell lines, and Cluster 68 for muscle contraction in cardiomyocytes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) each with 4 experiments, and [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774) and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) each with 3 experiments.


The transcription factor [2623](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623) was found to be regulating genes in one Perturb-seq experiment, according to data from GTRD's database of transcription factor binding sites and the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).



The genome-wide association study has identified a link between PDE4DIP and [Severe COVID-19 infection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36662838), with the closest MeSH match being [Infections](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007239). This association was determined using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart and muscle, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, amygdala, fetal brain, hypothalamus, spinal cord, thalamus, skeletal muscle, and tongue.



The mouse ortholog gene 83679 and its human ortholog gene 9659 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.
