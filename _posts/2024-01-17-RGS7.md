[RGS7](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000182901-RGS7) is a gene involved in GTPase activation and signal transduction inhibition, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. It is detected in some tissues and is primarily localized in the mitochondria and cytosol. RGS7 is notably expressed in the brain, specifically in synaptic signal transduction (Cluster 22), and in neurons involved in synaptic function (Cluster 65). Additionally, it is expressed in thyroid cancer cell lines associated with neuronal signaling (Cluster 16). While RGS7 is unprognostic for several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney chromophobe, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and testicular germ cell tumor, its role in these contexts remains an area of interest.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 6 experiments, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 5 experiments, [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 5 experiments, [KDM2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/84678) with 5 experiments, and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as male reproductive organ cancer, testicular cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, intestinal cancer, large intestine cancer, gastrointestinal system cancer, lung cancer, and respiratory system cancer. Additionally, metabolic disorders are prominent, encompassing diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and carbohydrate metabolism disease. Cardiovascular and vascular diseases are also represented, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular system disease. Furthermore, the data includes nervous system diseases such as cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder. Other notable conditions include kidney disease, urinary system disease, and substance-related disorders like alcohol dependence.



The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, whole brain, cingulate cortex, medulla oblongata, occipital lobe, and globus pallidus. Additionally, it is expressed in the pituitary and adrenal gland.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including g alpha (i) signaling events, gpcr downstream signaling, signaling by gpcr, and signal transduction.
