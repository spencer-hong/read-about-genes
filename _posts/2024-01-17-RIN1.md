The gene enables [guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005085) and [GTPase activator activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005096), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005856), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). The gene is active in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and [endocytic vesicle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030139), and is involved in [endocytosis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006897) and [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165). Additionally, it enables [small GTPase binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031267).


The gene length is 37,048 base pairs (58.45% of all genes), the mature length is 1,704.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 32,813.5 base pairs.


The gene RIN1 (NCBI ID: 9610) has been mentioned in [38 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RIN1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2003 and 2013. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning RIN1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Safety and efficacy of rituximab in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (RIN-1 study): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32199095)" (2020) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 14.29, "[Ras-activated endocytosis is mediated by the Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange activity of RIN1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11703925)" (2001) with an RCR of 3.49, "[The RAS effector RIN1 directly competes with RAF and is regulated by 14-3-3 proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11784866)" (2002) with an RCR of 1.94, "[A consistent pattern of RIN1 rearrangements in oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines supports a breakage-fusion-bridge cycle model for 11q13 amplification.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825000)" (2000) with an RCR of 1.5, and "[Protein binding and signaling properties of RIN1 suggest a unique effector function.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9144171)" (1997) with an RCR of 1.48. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RIN1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000174791-RIN1) is a gene with a molecular function in GTPase activation. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, playing a role in the innate immune response. It is also involved in endocytosis and is found in various cell types, including squamous epithelial cells where it contributes to keratinization. In the brain, RIN1 is expressed in the forebrain, suggesting a mixed function. Additionally, it is expressed in neuronal cell lines, indicating a role in signal transduction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 7 experiments, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 6 experiments, [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) with 6 experiments, [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772) with 5 experiments, and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.




The gene RIN1 has been associated with [Educational attainment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35361970), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Educational Status](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004522) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the vagina and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the thalamus, cingulate cortex, parietal lobe, pons, cerebellum peduncles, and atrioventricular node.
