The gene is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and the [cell surface](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009986). It is involved in various biological processes, including [angiogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001525), [apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006915), [inflammatory response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006954), [integrin-mediated signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007229), and [positive regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008284). Additionally, it plays a role in [cell migration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016477), [positive regulation of cell-cell adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0022409), and the regulation of various cytokine productions, including [type II interferon](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032649), [interleukin-10](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032653), [interleukin-12](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032655), [interleukin-6](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032675), and [tumor necrosis factor](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032680). The gene also enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [thrombospondin receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070053), and is active in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). Furthermore, it acts upstream of or within [ATP export](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1904669) and is involved in the [positive regulation of monocyte extravasation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:2000439).


The gene length is 93,304 base pairs (80.6% of all genes), the mature length is 1,829 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 78,571 base pairs.


The gene CD47, with NCBI ID 961, has been mentioned in [319 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CD47%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning CD47 is 1984, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning CD47, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[CD47 Blockade by Hu5F9-G4 and Rituximab in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30380386)" (2018) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 27.02, "[CD47 is an adverse prognostic factor and therapeutic antibody target on human acute myeloid leukemia stem cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19632179)" (2009) with an RCR of 23.0, "[CD47 is upregulated on circulating hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia cells to avoid phagocytosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19632178)" (2009) with an RCR of 21.23, "[CD47 blockade triggers T cell-mediated destruction of immunogenic tumors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26322579)" (2015) with an RCR of 14.52, and "[Advances in Anti-Tumor Treatments Targeting the CD47/SIRPÎ± Axis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32082311)" (2020) with an RCR of 13.61. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[CD47](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196776-CD47) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized in vesicles and the plasma membrane. CD47 is part of Cluster 12 for blood expression, which is non-specific and related to mitochondrial translation. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 40, which is non-specific and related to transcription. For brain expression, it is in Cluster 34, which is non-specific and has mixed functions. In cell line expression, it is part of Cluster 30, which is non-specific and related to gene expression regulation. In single-cell expression, it belongs to Cluster 45, which is non-specific and has mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 6 experiments, [TRIM24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8805) and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) each with 5 experiments, and [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341) and [NFE2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4778) each with 4 experiments.
