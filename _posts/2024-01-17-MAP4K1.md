The gene enables [protein serine/threonine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004674) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is involved in [protein phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006468), [JNK cascade](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007254), and [cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008283). It is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and located in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). Additionally, it enables [MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008349) and [protein serine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0106310), and is involved in [peptidyl-serine phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0018105), [intracellular signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035556), [positive regulation of MAPK cascade](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043410), [protein autophosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046777), and [cellular response to phorbol 13-acetate 12-myristate](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1904628).


The gene length is 70,903 base pairs (74.81 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 1,036 base pairs (23.79 percentile of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 22,715 base pairs (55.09 percentile of all genes).


The gene MAP4K1 (NCBI ID: 11184) has been mentioned in [55 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MAP4K1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1996 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2004 and 2020. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning MAP4K1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Tumorigenesis suppressor Pdcd4 down-regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 expression to suppress colon carcinoma cell invasion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16449643)" (2006) with a relative citation ratio of 3.47, "[Human HPK1, a novel human hematopoietic progenitor kinase that activates the JNK/SAPK kinase cascade.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8824585)" (1996) with a relative citation ratio of 3.3, "[Hematopoietic Progenitor Kinase1 (HPK1) Mediates T Cell Dysfunction and Is a Druggable Target for T Cell-Based Immunotherapies.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32860752)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 3.19, "[HPK1, a hematopoietic protein kinase activating the SAPK/JNK pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9003777)" (1996) with a relative citation ratio of 3.11, and "[PDIA6 modulates apoptosis and autophagy of non-small cell lung cancer cells via the MAP4K1/JNK signaling pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30922965)" (2019) with a relative citation ratio of 2.82. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MAP4K1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000104814-MAP4K1) is a kinase with serine/threonine-protein kinase and transferase molecular functions. Evidence for this protein is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in lymphoid tissue related to immune response, macrophages and microglia in the brain, and lymphoma cell lines. Subcellularly, MAP4K1 is located in the plasma membrane. In blood, its expression is non-specific and associated with mitochondria. The gene is also expressed in photoreceptor cells involved in visual perception.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667), [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980), and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including cancer, diseases of cellular proliferation, cardiovascular system diseases, and diseases of anatomical entities.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Lymphoma Burkitts (Raji), 721 B lymphoblasts, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), and Leukemia promyelocytic-HL-60.
