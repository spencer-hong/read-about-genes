The gene length is 634,102.0 base pairs (98.97% of all genes), the mature length is 1,726.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 574,227.5 base pairs (99.46% of all genes).


The gene CCL11 has an NCBI Gene ID of 6356. It has been featured in [406 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CCL11%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2000 and 2012.


The top five publications mentioning CCL11, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Selective expression of the eotaxin receptor CCR3 by human T helper 2 cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9302298)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 17.87), "[Eotaxin: a potent eosinophil chemoattractant cytokine detected in a guinea pig model of allergic airways inflammation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7509365)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 17.09), "[Human eotaxin is a specific chemoattractant for eosinophil cells and provides a new mechanism to explain tissue eosinophilia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8597956)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 14.94), "[Cloning of the human eosinophil chemoattractant, eotaxin. Expression, receptor binding, and functional properties suggest a mechanism for the selective recruitment of eosinophils.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8609214)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 14.83), and "[Molecular cloning and characterization of a human eotaxin receptor expressed selectively on eosinophils.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8676064)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 11.86). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [Cytokine](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) is involved in cancer-related processes and has evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in the intestine, contributing to digestion. Additionally, it is found in connective tissue cells, playing a role in extracellular matrix organization. The gene is also involved in non-specific transcription processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) with 3 experiments, [TCF21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6943) with 1 experiment, [ATF7IP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55729) with 1 experiment, [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 1 experiment, and [CREBBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1387) with 1 experiment.











The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.172 (72nd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 11.45 at pH 7.0 (84.19th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.002 (52.15th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are notable, with 39.18% of residues tending to be in a helix (91.85th percentile), 32.99% in a sheet (45.43rd percentile), and 25.77% in a turn (27.3rd percentile).
