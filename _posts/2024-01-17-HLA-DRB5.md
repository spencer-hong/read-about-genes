The gene HLA-DRB5 (NCBI ID: 3127) has been mentioned in [21 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22HLA-DRB5%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1992, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2005 to 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning HLA-DRB5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Association of Brain DNA methylation in SORL1, ABCA7, HLA-DRB5, SLC24A4, and BIN1 with pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25365775)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 6.7), "[Ligand motifs of HLA-DRB5*0101 and DRB1*1501 molecules delineated from self-peptides.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7519208)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 2.94), "[Uncoupling the roles of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DRB5 genes in multiple sclerosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18832704)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 1.69), "[Identification of the novel HLA-DRB5*02:21 allele in a Saudi individual.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30821125)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 1.27), and "[Comparative genomic hybridisation analysis of keloid tissue in Caucasians suggests possible involvement of HLA-DRB5 in disease pathogenesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22033527)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 1.18). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[HLA-DRB5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198502-HLA-DRB5) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and it is expressed in dendritic cells with an unknown function in the blood. In tissues, it is part of Cluster 70, which is associated with lymphoid tissue and immune response. In the brain, it is found in Cluster 20, which includes macrophages and microglia involved in immune response. Additionally, it is expressed in lymphoma cell lines, contributing to the adaptive immune response, and in single cells, it is part of Cluster 28, which includes dendritic cells involved in antigen presentation.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) with 3 experiments, followed by [CREB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1385), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [CEBPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1050), and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), each with 2 experiments.




The HLA-DRB5 gene has been associated with several diseases and traits through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28540026), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Autistic Disorder](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001321) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, HLA-DRB5 has been associated with [Hand grip strength](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29691431), mapped to the MeSH term [Hand Strength](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D018737), and [Tuberculosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29036319), which directly matches the MeSH term [Tuberculosis](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D014376).


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung and spleen.


The input data highlights various pathways involved in immune system function, including cytokine signaling in the immune system, interferon signaling, and interferon gamma signaling. Additionally, it covers adaptive immune system processes, costimulation by the CD28 family, and downstream TCR signaling. Other notable pathways include TCR signaling, generation of second messenger molecules, PD-1 signaling, phosphorylation of CD3 and TCR zeta chains, translocation of ZAP-70 to the immunological synapse, and MHC class II antigen presentation.
