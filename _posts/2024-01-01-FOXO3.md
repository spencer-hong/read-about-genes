The gene length is 704.0 base pairs (0.85 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 637.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 637.0 base pairs.


FOXO3, with NCBI Gene ID 2309, has been the subject of [1,208 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FOXO3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink). The earliest year of publication is 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2013 and 2020.


The top five publications mentioning FOXO3, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows: ["Stress-dependent regulation of FOXO transcription factors by the SIRT1 deacetylase."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14976264) (2004) (relative citation ratio: 51.79), ["Foxo3 circular RNA retards cell cycle progression via forming ternary complexes with p21 and CDK2."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26861625) (2016) (relative citation ratio: 44.53), ["FoxO3 controls autophagy in skeletal muscle in vivo."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18054315) (2007) (relative citation ratio: 32.25), ["Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a protects quiescent cells from oxidative stress."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12239572) (2002) (relative citation ratio: 23.06), and ["Foxo3 circular RNA promotes cardiac senescence by modulating multiple factors associated with stress and senescence responses."](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26873092) (2017) (relative citation ratio: 22.18). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NEUROD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4760) with 6 experiments, [TFAP2C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7022) with 5 experiments, [ARID2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/196528) with 5 experiments, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) with 5 experiments, and [NFYA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4800) with 5 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 56484, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 2309, has been associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal retina morphology, decreased bone mineral density, decreased prepulse inhibition, increased heart weight, increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and increased mean corpuscular volume, all of which are observed in both sexes. Additionally, abnormal sleep behavior has been noted, although this phenotype is not observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.594 (25.93rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -18.67 (12.08th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.012 (86.68th percentile). The protein has a high instability index of 66.77 (92.11th percentile) and an isoelectric point of 4.98 (7.49th percentile). The sequence length is 673 amino acids (73.69th percentile) with a molecular weight of 71275.87 Da (71.37th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 28.08% for helix (17.49th percentile), 24.81% for sheet (8.29th percentile), and 44.13% for turn (98.99th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
