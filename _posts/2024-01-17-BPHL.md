The gene is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739) and specifically in the [mitochondrial outer membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005741). It is involved in the [amino acid metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006520) and the [xenobiotic metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006805), as well as the [response to toxic substance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009636). Additionally, it enables [alpha-amino-acid esterase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0047658).


The gene length is 74,958 base pairs (75.98th percentile), the mature length is 3,037.5 base pairs (73.01st percentile), and the primary transcript length is 49,400 base pairs (74.94th percentile).


The gene BPHL (NCBI ID: 670) has been mentioned in [6 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22BPHL%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest publication mentioning BPHL was in 1990, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2011.


The top 5 publications mentioning BPHL include "[Molecular basis of prodrug activation by human valacyclovirase, an alpha-amino acid ester hydrolase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18256025)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 1.35), "[A novel nucleoside prodrug-activating enzyme: substrate specificity of biphenyl hydrolase-like protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15832508)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 0.9), "[Cloning and sequencing of a complementary DNA encoding a Mr 70,000 human breast epithelial mucin-associated antigen.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2393862)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 0.45), "[Structure and specificity of a human valacyclovir activating enzyme: a homology model of BPHL.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16028355)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 0.28), and "[Synthesis and characterization of valyloxy methoxy luciferin for the detection of valacyclovirase and peptide transporter.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25240255)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 0.28). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[BPHL](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137274-BPHL) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is expressed in all tissues, with notable expression in the liver and kidney, where it is involved in metabolism. Subcellularly, the protein is localized to the mitochondria. In the brain, BPHL is expressed in neurons and is associated with synaptic function. Additionally, the gene is expressed in proximal tubular cells, contributing to amino acid metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) and [SMAD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4087), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908), and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the liver, kidney, prostate, pancreas, pancreatic islet, small intestine, and fetal liver. Additionally, it is expressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562) cells.




The analyzed protein sequence exhibits a GRAVY value of -0.526, indicating a hydrophilic nature (32.28th percentile). The charge at pH 7.0 is -2.36 (41.76th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.003 (54.58th percentile). The protein has a predicted affinity for helix and sheet structures of 32.2% and 32.6%, respectively (51.75th and 42.95th percentiles), with a turn affinity of 29.0% (56.32nd percentile). The instability index is 42.8 (31.37th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 7.62 (55.38th percentile). The sequence length is approximately 633.5 amino acids (71.06th percentile), with a molecular weight of 71825.66 Da (71.74th percentile).
