VEGFD (Gene ID: 2277) has been mentioned in [201 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22VEGFD%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning VEGFD was in 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning VEGFD, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[VEGF-D is the strongest angiogenic and lymphangiogenic effector among VEGFs delivered into skeletal muscle via adenoviruses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12714562)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 6.41), "[VEGF-D promotes tumor metastasis by regulating prostaglandins produced by the collecting lymphatic endothelium.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22340592)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 5.58), "[Biosynthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor-D involves proteolytic processing which generates non-covalent homodimers.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10542248)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 5.53), "[VEGF-C and VEGF-D expression in neuroendocrine cells and their receptor, VEGFR-3, in fenestrated blood vessels in human tissues.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11023993)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 5.34), and "[Molecular cloning of a novel vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF-D.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9205122)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 4.63). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[VEGFD](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000165197-VEGFD) is a developmental protein, growth factor, and mitogen with evidence at the protein level. It is involved in cancer-related genes and is detected in many tissues. VEGFD is expressed in adipose tissue with mixed function (Cluster 7), neurons with mixed function (Cluster 24), BICR 18 protein kinases (Cluster 61), and fibroblasts involved in ECM organization (Cluster 53). While it is unprognostic for several cancer types, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, its role in cancer biology remains significant.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1051), [CEBPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1050), and [CENPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1058) were each found in 2 experiments.




VEGFD has been associated with [vascular endothelial growth factor D levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25147954), which has been mapped to the closest existing MeSH term [Growth](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006128) using a method called [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including breast and lung, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), adipocytes, lung, small intestine, ovary, and fetal lung.


The proteins are involved in various pathways, including signaling by VEGF, signal transduction, hemostasis, platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, platelet degranulation, and response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca2+. Additionally, they participate in VEGF binding to VEGFR, leading to receptor dimerization, and VEGF ligand-receptor interactions.


The mouse ortholog gene 14205 and its human ortholog gene 2277 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal heart morphology, abnormal thymus morphology, enlarged heart, and enlarged thymus.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.556 (29.23rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 5.58 at pH 7.0 (69.81st percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.002 (50.41st percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 28.81% helix (22.18th percentile), 28.53% sheet (20.8th percentile), and 26.27% turn (31.59th percentile). The instability index is 56.81 (76.65th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.16 (60.58th percentile). The protein has a length of 354 amino acids (38.72nd percentile) and a molecular weight of 40444.03 Da (39.99th percentile).
