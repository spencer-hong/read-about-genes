The gene length is 691,654 base pairs (99.12% of all genes), the mature length is 7,496.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 680,344 base pairs (99.62% of all genes).


The gene CYP2F1, with NCBI Gene ID 1572, has been the subject of [17 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CYP2F1%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1990, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2011.


The top five publications mentioning CYP2F1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The human CYP2F gene subfamily: identification of a cDNA encoding a new cytochrome P450, cDNA-directed expression, and chromosome mapping.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1974816)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 3.5), "[Specific dehydrogenation of 3-methylindole and epoxidation of naphthalene by recombinant human CYP2F1 expressed in lymphoblastoid cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10383923)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 2.5), "[Benzene metabolism in human lung cell lines BEAS-2B and A549 and cells overexpressing CYP2F1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15122651)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 1.44), "[Human CYP2A13 and CYP2F1 Mediate Naphthalene Toxicity in the Lung and Nasal Mucosa of CYP2A13/2F1-Humanized Mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28599267)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.4), and "[3-Methylindole metabolites induce lung CYP1A1 and CYP2F1 enzymes by AhR and non-AhR mechanisms, respectively.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187624)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 1.12). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [CYP1A1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000140560-CYP1A1) functions as a monooxygenase and oxidoreductase, with evidence supporting its activity at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in the testis and squamous epithelial cells, particularly those involved in keratinization. The gene is also expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, although its function in these cells is unknown. Prognostic analyses indicate that the gene is unprognostic in several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, and testicular germ cell tumors.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 4 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 3 experiments, [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 3 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 2 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 13107 and its human ortholog gene 1572 are associated with the phenotype of an enlarged spleen, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.047 (81.54th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -0.28 (49.17th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.994 (17.69th percentile), with a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 31.6% (46.47th percentile), 39.5% (84.75th percentile), and 28.9% (55.25th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 46.8 (45.78th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.93 (49.55th percentile). The protein is 491 amino acids long (57.11th percentile) with a molecular weight of 55500.6 Da (57.91st percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, which can be explored [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
