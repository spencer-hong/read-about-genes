The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980) and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) each with 4 experiments, and [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088) and [GATAD2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54815) each with 3 experiments.





The genome-wide association study has identified a link between genetic variations and [C4b binding protein levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20212171), with the closest MeSH match being [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506). This association was determined using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method, which mapped the trait to its corresponding MeSH term through embedding match.





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.276 (60.66th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7, the protein carries a charge of -11.1 (20.82nd percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.002 (49.45th percentile), with a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 33.7% (65.65th percentile), 32.5% (42.65th percentile), and 28.2% (48.92nd percentile), respectively. The instability index is 34.9 (9.99th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.05 (8.69th percentile). The protein is 252 amino acids long (21.94th percentile) with a molecular weight of 28357.2 Da (22.36th percentile).
