The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [angiogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001525), [monocyte chemotaxis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002548), and [transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007169). It enables functions such as [transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004714), [vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005021), and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). The gene is located in multiple cellular components, including the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), [endosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005768), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and [focal adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005925). Additionally, it plays a role in [multicellular organism development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007275), [positive regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008284), and [cell migration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016477). The gene is also part of the [receptor complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043235) and is involved in various signaling pathways, including the [vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0038084) and the [MAPK cascade](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043410).


The gene length is 4,973 base pairs (13.89% of all genes), the mature length is 1,211 base pairs (29.35% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 4,973 base pairs (18.52% of all genes).


The gene FLT1 (NCBI ID: 2321) has been mentioned in [991 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FLT1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning FLT1 is 1976, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning FLT1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Different signal transduction properties of KDR and Flt1, two receptors for vascular endothelial growth factor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7929439)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 31.28), "[Imaging proliferation in vivo with [F-18]FLT and positron emission tomography.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9809561)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 23.91), "[Nucleotide sequence and expression of a novel human receptor-type tyrosine kinase gene (flt) closely related to the fms family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2158038)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 19.22), "[The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor Flt-1 mediates biological activities. Implications for a functional role of placenta growth factor in monocyte activation and chemotaxis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8663424)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 17.17), and "[Revascularization of ischemic tissues by PlGF treatment, and inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, arthritis and atherosclerosis by anti-Flt1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12091877)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 16.81). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[FLT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000102755-FLT1) is a developmental protein with kinase, receptor, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase molecular functions. It is implicated in cancer-related genes and is an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence for FLT1 is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the placenta during pregnancy, endothelial cells in the vasculature, HMC-1 cells involved in the innate immune response, and extravillous trophoblasts. Subcellularly, FLT1 is localized to the plasma membrane, actin filaments, and cytosol.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.
