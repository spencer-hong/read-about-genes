The gene length is 7,828 base pairs (20.86% of all genes), the mature length is 1,968.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 4,263 base pairs.


The gene MSTN (NCBI ID: 2660) has been mentioned in [660 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MSTN%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2019.


The top five publications mentioning MSTN, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Regulation of myostatin activity and muscle growth.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11459935)" (2001) with a relative citation ratio of 24.08, "[Myostatin mutation associated with gross muscle hypertrophy in a child.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15215484)" (2004) with a relative citation ratio of 20.73, "[Myostatin reduces Akt/TORC1/p70S6K signaling, inhibiting myoblast differentiation and myotube size.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19357233)" (2009) with a relative citation ratio of 14.39, "[Myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, functions by inhibiting myoblast proliferation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10976104)" (2000) with a relative citation ratio of 14.22, and "[Induction of cachexia in mice by systemically administered myostatin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12029139)" (2002) with a relative citation ratio of 13.73. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[MSTN](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000138379-MSTN) is a gene with molecular functions as a cytokine, growth factor, and heparin-binding protein. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in some tissues, and it is classified in tissue expression cluster 3, indicating non-specific expression with an unknown function. In the brain, it is part of cluster 31, associated with non-specific transcription. In cell lines, MSTN is found in cluster 33, linked to sarcoma and muscle contraction, while in single cells, it is part of cluster 53, involved in fibroblasts and ECM organization. The gene is unprognostic for Breast Invasive Carcinoma (validation), Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA and validation), and Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 2 experiments, [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) with 1 experiment, [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) with 1 experiment, [MLXIP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/22877) with 1 experiment, and [SS18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6760) with 1 experiment.
