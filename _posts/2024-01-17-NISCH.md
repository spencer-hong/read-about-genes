[NISCH](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000010322-NISCH) is a receptor with evidence at the protein level, making it an FDA-approved drug target. The gene is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, vesicles, microtubules, cytokinetic bridge, and cytosol. It is part of Cluster 30 for blood expression, indicating non-specific DNA binding, and Cluster 65 for tissue expression, which is associated with cerebellum and nervous system development. In the brain, it belongs to Cluster 10, linked to cerebellum and nucleic acid binding. Additionally, NISCH is found in Cluster 8 for cell line expression, involved in basic cellular processes, and Cluster 58 for single-cell expression, related to macrophages and innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [NR2F2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7026), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cancer, particularly leukemia and its subtypes such as acute leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoblastic leukemia. Additionally, the data highlights diseases of cellular proliferation, organ system cancer, hematologic cancer, immune system cancer, and metabolic disorders, specifically acquired metabolic diseases and nutrition-related conditions like overnutrition and obesity.


The genome-wide association study identified a significant association with the trait [Waist circumference adjusted for body mass index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31669095), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020481) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in the prostate and pituitary according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in the amygdala, cerebellum, prostate, pituitary, and testis.
