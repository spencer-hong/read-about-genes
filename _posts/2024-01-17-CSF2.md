The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [histamine secretion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001821), [embryonic placenta development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001892), and [immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006955). It enables [cytokine activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005125) and [granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005129), and is part of the [granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030526). The gene is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and is active in the extracellular space. Additionally, it is involved in the [receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007259) and various regulation processes, including positive regulation of cell population proliferation, gene expression, and cell migration. The gene also plays a role in the differentiation of myeloid cells, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as the response to various stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Furthermore, it is involved in the regulation of circadian sleep/wake cycle, negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription, and negative regulation of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in the absence of ligand.


The gene length is 71,495 base pairs (75th percentile of all genes), the mature length is 887 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 12,008 base pairs.


The gene CSF2 (NCBI ID: 1437) has been mentioned in [4,829 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CSF2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1946, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1993 and 2010.


The top 5 publications mentioning CSF2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Efficient presentation of soluble antigen by cultured human dendritic cells is maintained by granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor plus interleukin 4 and downregulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8145033)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 96.05), "[A conserved AU sequence from the 3' untranslated region of GM-CSF mRNA mediates selective mRNA degradation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3488815)" (1986) (relative citation ratio: 86.6), "[Human GM-CSF: molecular cloning of the complementary DNA and purification of the natural and recombinant proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3923623)" (1985) (relative citation ratio: 32.14), "[GM-CSF and TNF-alpha cooperate in the generation of dendritic Langerhans cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1279441)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 30.43), and "[Effect of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on hematopoietic reconstitution after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3281007)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 28.45). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CSF2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000164400-CSF2) is a gene encoding a protein with cytokine and growth factor functions. It is involved in cancer-related processes and has evidence at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in single tissue, and its protein is localized in vesicles. CSF2 is expressed in NK-cells with an unknown function in the blood and is associated with lung function in tissue expression. In cell lines, it is expressed in leukemia cells related to the T-cell receptor, and in single cells, it is found in NK-cells and T-cells, playing roles in the immune system and transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), and [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) were each found to be regulating in 3 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including skin, lung, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, CD14+ monocytes, CD71+ early erythroid cells, adipocytes, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung, and skeletal muscle.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to immune system function and signaling, including cytokine signaling in the immune system, interleukin receptor SHC signaling, and signaling by interleukins. Additionally, they participate in G-protein beta:gamma signaling, GPCR downstream signaling, and signal transduction. Furthermore, these proteins play roles in hemostasis and platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation.
