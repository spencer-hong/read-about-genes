[PAFAH1B3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000079462-PAFAH1B3) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized to intermediate filaments within cells. Its expression is notably elevated in the cerebellum, contributing to nervous system development, and in the hypothalamus, where it plays a role in neuropeptide signaling. Additionally, PAFAH1B3 is expressed in MÃ¼ller glia cells, which are crucial for visual perception.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869), [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.
