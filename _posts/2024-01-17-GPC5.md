The gene GPC5 (NCBI ID: 2262) has been mentioned in [37 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GPC5%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2011 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning GPC5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A targeted functional RNA interference screen uncovers glypican 5 as an entry factor for hepatitis B and D viruses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26224662)" (2016) with a relative citation ratio of 4.64, "[Glypican-5 stimulates rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation by activating Hedgehog signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21339334)" (2011) with a relative citation ratio of 2.77, "[Expression of the cell surface proteoglycan glypican-5 is developmentally regulated in kidney, limb, and brain.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9331333)" (1997) with a relative citation ratio of 2.38, "[GPC5, a novel epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor, inhibits tumor growth by suppressing Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling in lung adenocarcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27157618)" (2016) with a relative citation ratio of 2.08, and "[Glypican-5 is a novel metastasis suppressor gene in non-small cell lung cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23962560)" (2013) with a relative citation ratio of 1.48. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[GPC5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000179399-GPC5) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in some RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. The gene is highly expressed in the brain and testis, with a notable role in signal transduction. In the brain, it is specifically expressed in neurons with mixed functions. Additionally, GPC5 is expressed in liver cancer cell lines, where it is involved in metabolism, and in astrocytes, although its function in this context is unknown. The gene has been found to be unprognostic in several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908), and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including nephrosis, nephrotic syndrome, various infectious diseases such as those caused by viral agents and human immunodeficiency virus, and multiple types of cancer, particularly lung cancer and leukocyte diseases. Additionally, the data highlights associations with metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and hypertension. Neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and schizophrenia, are also implicated. Furthermore, the data shows links to developmental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eye diseases such as myopia, and sleep disorders like narcolepsy. Other notable associations include multiple sclerosis, gastrointestinal system diseases, and endocrine system diseases like hypothyroidism.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, pituitary, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (day), caudate nucleus, appendix, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscle, atrioventricular node, ciliary ganglion, and skin.


The input data includes various pathways and diseases related to carbohydrate metabolism, glycosaminoglycan metabolism, and glycosylation. Notable conditions include Myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora, Glycogen storage diseases, and several types of Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), such as Sly syndrome, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, and various Sanfilippo syndromes. Defects in specific genes like B3GAT3, B4GALT1, CHST14, and EXT1/EXT2 are associated with distinct disorders, including JDSSDHD, B4GALT1-CDG, EDS types, and exostoses. Additionally, the data covers visual transduction, retinoid metabolism, and Hedgehog signaling pathways, highlighting the diverse biological processes involved.
