The gene TPI1 (NCBI ID: 7167) has been mentioned in [369 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TPI1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1952 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1977 and 2008. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning TPI1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[One fold with many functions: the evolutionary relationships between TIM barrel families based on their sequences, structures and functions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12206759)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 9.6), "[Free-energy profile of the reaction catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/999838)" (1976) (relative citation ratio: 6.71), "[The TIM-barrel fold: a versatile framework for efficient enzymes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11257493)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 6.38), "[Anatomy of a conformational change: hinged 'lid' motion of the triosephosphate isomerase loop.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2402636)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 6.3), and "[Triosephosphate isomerase catalysis is diffusion controlled. Appendix: Analysis of triose phosphate equilibria in aqueous solution by 31P NMR.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3365378)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 5.92). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TPI1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111669-TPI1) is a gene encoding an isomerase and lyase protein, with evidence at the protein level. It is involved in various diseases, including cancer-related genes, disease variants, and hereditary hemolytic anemia. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the nucleoplasm. Its expression is notable in skeletal muscle for tissue expression, neurons for brain expression, and it is involved in transcription in cell line expression. The gene's expression in blood is non-specific with an unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [NONO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4841), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), each with 5 experiments demonstrating their regulatory roles.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including nervous system disease, eye and adnexa disease, eye disease, sensory system disease, retinal disease, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vascular disease.



The gene is expressed in the adrenal gland and blood according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in various tissues, including the heart, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, temporal lobe, cerebellum, kidney, and globus pallidus.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, including gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and glucose metabolism. Additionally, they play roles in diseases such as myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora and glycogen storage diseases.
