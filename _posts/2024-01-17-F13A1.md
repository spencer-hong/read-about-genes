Additionally, it is part of the [transferase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990234).


The gene length is 3,008 base pairs (8.23% of all genes), the mature length is 2,279.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 2,846 base pairs (10.15% of all genes).


The gene F13A1 (NCBI ID: 2162) has been mentioned in [316 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22F13A1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1964 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1991 and 2010. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning F13A1, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[Characterization of factor XIIIa positive dermal dendritic cells in normal and inflamed skin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2576222)" (1989) (RCR: 8.18), "[Cross-linking of collagen and fibronectin by factor XIIIa. Localization of participating glutaminyl residues to a tryptic fragment of fibronectin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7356656)" (1980) (RCR: 7.96), "[A study of factor XIIIa and MAC 387 immunolabeling in normal and pathological skin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1972317)" (1990) (RCR: 7.28), "[Latent transforming growth factor-beta binding protein domains involved in activation and transglutaminase-dependent cross-linking of latent transforming growth factor-beta.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9060478)" (1997) (RCR: 6.9), and "[Double-crosslinked effect of TGase and EGCG on myofibrillar proteins gel based on physicochemical properties and molecular docking.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33302098)" (2021) (RCR: 5.55). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[F13A1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000124491-F13A1) is a gene with acyltransferase and transferase molecular functions, and it is involved in cancer-related processes, serving as a disease variant and an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in monocytes and neutrophils involved in degranulation (Cluster 38), placenta during pregnancy (Cluster 58), immune cells in the brain (Cluster 8), myeloid leukemia cell lines (Cluster 14), and macrophages involved in innate immune response (Cluster 58).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 6 experiments, [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) with 5 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 4 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 4 experiments, and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are highlighted. Metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity, are also prominent. Cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease and vascular disease are noted, along with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. Mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and mood disorders, are also represented. Furthermore, the data includes musculoskeletal system diseases like osteoporosis and muscular atrophy, as well as cerebrovascular and blood coagulation diseases.


The F13A1 gene has been associated with several diseases and traits through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [coronary artery disease in dyslipidemia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33632238), which maps closely to [Atherosclerosis](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D050197) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, F13A1 is associated with [end-stage coagulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23381943), closely matching [Thromboinflammation](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000090882). Furthermore, it has been found to influence serum levels of proteins FN1, FRS2, and SERPINF2, all of which map to the MeSH term [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506). These associations highlight the multifaceted role of F13A1 in various biological processes and diseases.


The gene is expressed in adipose tissue, as well as in various immune cell types including CD33+ myeloid cells and CD14+ monocytes. Additionally, it is found in whole blood, placenta, skin, ovary, and fetal lung, indicating a ubiquitous expression across multiple tissue samples.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including the common pathway, formation of fibrin clot (clotting cascade), hemostasis, platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, platelet degranulation, and response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca2+.
