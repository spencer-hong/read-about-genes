The gene length is 1,102,672.0 base pairs (99.67% of all genes), the mature length is 4,160.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 1,102,669.0 base pairs.


The gene C4A, with NCBI ID 720, has been the subject of [243 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22C4A%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1970, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1988 and 2010.


The top five publications mentioning C4A, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include "[Overexpression of schizophrenia susceptibility factor human complement C4A promotes excessive synaptic loss and behavioral changes in mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33353966)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 13.61), "[Leukotrienes C4, D4 and E4: effects on human and guinea-pig cardiac preparations in vitro.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6278136)" (1982) (relative citation ratio: 8.4), "[A comparison of the properties of two classes, C4A and C4B, of the human complement component C4.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6332733)" (1984) (relative citation ratio: 6.94), "[International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. [corrected]. LXXXVII. Complement peptide C5a, C4a, and C3a receptors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23383423)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 5.62), and "[Steric and electronic properties of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC): a detailed study on their interaction with Ni(CO)4.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15725003)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 5.61). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [Blood group antigen](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) functions as a blood group antigen and is implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus, with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in the liver, where it plays a role in metabolism. In the brain, it is found in astrocytes with mixed functions. The gene is also expressed in the DU4475 cell line and hepatocytes, where it is involved in metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [RING1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6015), and [STAT2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6773), each shown to be regulating in 2 experiments. Additionally, [RBFOX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23543) and [DNMT3B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1789) were each found to be regulating in 1 experiment.
