The gene length is 388 base pairs (0.25 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 388 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 388 base pairs.


The gene POLR2L, with NCBI ID 5441, has been featured in [3 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLR2L%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 2017, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2017 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top publications mentioning POLR2L include "[Expression of the RNA-binding protein RBP10 promotes the bloodstream-form differentiation state in Trypanosoma brucei.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28800584)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 2.49) and "[The expression of Rpb10, a small subunit common to RNA polymerases, is modulated by the R3H domain-containing Rbs1 protein and the Upf1 helicase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33231687)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.69). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) and [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [SMARCB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6598), and [TCF12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6938) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 66491 and its human ortholog gene 5441 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.175 (89.91 percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of 0.556 (52.05 percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.981 (5.22 percentile), suggesting a highly flexible structure. The protein has a notable affinity for helical structures (0.448, 98.17 percentile) and sheet structures (0.403, 87.11 percentile), with a lower affinity for turns (0.179, 0.85 percentile). The instability index is 35.2 (10.48 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 7.65 (55.71 percentile). The protein sequence is 67 amino acids long (0.5 percentile) with a molecular weight of 7645.04 Da (0.54 percentile).
