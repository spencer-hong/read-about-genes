The gene is involved in various metabolic processes, including [very long-chain fatty acid metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000038), [fatty acid biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006633), and [fatty acid beta-oxidation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006635). It enables several molecular functions such as [long-chain fatty acid transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005324), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524). The gene is located in multiple cellular components, including [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739), [peroxisome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005777), [peroxisomal membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005778), [peroxisomal matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005782), and [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829). Additionally, it is involved in processes like [peroxisome organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007031), [response to xenobiotic stimulus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009410), and [long-chain fatty acid import into peroxisome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015910). The gene also enables activities such as [ATP hydrolysis activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016887) and [ATPase-coupled transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042626).


The gene length is 37,837 base pairs (58.91% of all genes), the mature length is 2,058 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 37,697 base pairs.


The gene ABCD3, with NCBI ID 5825, has been mentioned in [32 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ABCD3%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2006 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning ABCD3, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Peroxisomes can oxidize medium- and long-chain fatty acids through a pathway involving ABCD3 and HSD17B4.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30540494)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 4.43), "[A novel bile acid biosynthesis defect due to a deficiency of peroxisomal ABCD3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25168382)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 3.26), "[A role for the human peroxisomal half-transporter ABCD3 in the oxidation of dicarboxylic acids.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24333844)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 2.76), "[Catalog of 605 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 13 genes encoding human ATP-binding cassette transporters: ABCA4, ABCA7, ABCA8, ABCD1, ABCD3, ABCD4, ABCE1, ABCF1, ABCG1, ABCG2, ABCG4, ABCG5, and ABCG8.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12111378)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 2.17), and "[Validation of the ABCD3-I score to predict stroke risk after transient ischemic attack.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23532014)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.39). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[ABCD3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000117528-ABCD3) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase and translocase molecular functions, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is expressed in all tissues, with notable expression in the liver and intestine, where it is involved in lipid metabolism. Subcellularly, the protein is localized to peroxisomes. In the brain, ABCD3 is part of a non-specific transcription cluster, while in cell lines, it is associated with mRNA processing. Additionally, it is detected in basal prostatic cells, where it plays a role in lipid metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 6 experiments, [HIF1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3091) with 5 experiments, [TEAD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7003) with 5 experiments, [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 5 experiments, and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including liver, nerve, and colon, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in pineal gland (both day and night), amygdala, fetal brain, colon, small intestine, and fetal liver.


The input data highlights the involvement of ABC-family proteins in various transport processes. Specifically, these proteins mediate the transport of small molecules across membranes and play a crucial role in lipid homeostasis through ABCA transporters.


The mouse ortholog gene 19299 and its human ortholog 5825 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities, including abnormal cholesterol homeostasis, decreased circulating triglyceride levels, impaired righting response, improved glucose tolerance, increased circulating alkaline phosphatase levels, increased circulating calcium levels, increased circulating total protein levels, increased lean body mass, and limb grasping. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.130 (75.79th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 23.96 at pH 7.0 (95.4th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.993 (16.23rd percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 32.63% helix (56.23rd percentile), 40.52% sheet (87.7th percentile), and 24.89% turn (20.82nd percentile). The instability index is 34.53 (9.25th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.41 (89.33rd percentile). The protein has a length of 659 amino acids (72.72nd percentile) and a molecular weight of 75475.03 Da (73.82nd percentile).
