The gene length is 476.0 base pairs (0.39 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 476.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 476.0 base pairs.


The gene PNLIPRP1, with NCBI ID 5407, has been the subject of [2 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PNLIPRP1%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1992, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1995 and 2002.


The gene PNLIPRP1 has been notably discussed in several publications. The top publications by relative citation ratio (RCR), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, include "[Two novel human pancreatic lipase related proteins, hPLRP1 and hPLRP2. Differences in colipase dependence and in lipase activity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1379598)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 3.69) and "[Constitutive expression of human pancreatic lipase-related protein 1 in Pichia pastoris.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16481202)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 0.42). The citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [LMNB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4001) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [OTX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5015), [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) were each found to be regulating in 2 experiments.





The genome-wide association study identified a significant association between the gene PNLIPRP1 and the trait of [Inactive pancreatic lipase-related protein 1 level in Chronic kidney disease with hypertension and no diabetes (6627_25)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35870639). This trait was mapped to the closest existing MeSH term using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.253 (63.53rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -10.69 (21.48th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.001 (48.52nd percentile). The protein has a length of 467 amino acids (54.07th percentile) and a molecular weight of 51847.19 Da (53.78th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 28.27% for helix (18.62nd percentile), 37.90% for sheet (78.02nd percentile), and 30.62% for turn (68.25th percentile). The instability index is 23.33 (1.11th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.47 (17.59th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
