[SLC4A4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000080493-SLC4A4) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, known for its involvement in retinitis pigmentosa. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and cytosol. The gene shows distinct expression patterns, including Cluster 15 in the pancreas related to proteolysis, Cluster 40 in astrocytes involved in astrocyte-neuron interactions, and Cluster 15 in kidney cancer associated with membrane components. Additionally, it is expressed in single-cell clusters related to astrocytes with an unknown function.

Mental health conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder, are also implicated. Furthermore, the data highlights associations with hypersensitivity reactions, genetic diseases like long QT syndrome, cerebrovascular diseases including intracranial aneurysm, and endocrine system diseases such as Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism.


The gene SLC4A4 has been associated with [age-related nuclear cataracts](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24951543), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Cataract](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D002386) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the pancreas and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the cerebellum, pancreas, pancreatic islet, colon, kidney, and superior cervical ganglion.


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in transmembrane transport processes. These include the transport of inorganic cations/anions and amino acids/oligopeptides, SLC-mediated transmembrane transport, the transmembrane transport of small molecules, and the activity of bicarbonate transporters.
