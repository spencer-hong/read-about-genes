The gene is involved in [protein peptidyl-prolyl isomerization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000413) and [protein folding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006457). It enables [peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003755) and [cyclosporin A binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016018). The gene is active in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), and [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739), and is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886).


The gene length is 20,561 base pairs (42.73% of all genes), the mature length is 4,048 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 11,584 base pairs (37.17% of all genes).


The gene NKTR (NCBI ID: 4820) has been mentioned in [18 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NKTR%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2013 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning NKTR, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies such as "[Pharmacokinetics and lung delivery of PDDS-aerosolized amikacin (NKTR-061) in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with nosocomial pneumonia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20003269)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 3.18), "[Modeling the receptor pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of NKTR-214, a kinetically-controlled interleukin-2 (IL2) receptor agonist for cancer immunotherapy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28678791)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 3.14), "[NKTR-358: A novel regulatory T-cell stimulator that selectively stimulates expansion and suppressive function of regulatory T cells for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34041473)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.84), "[Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) versus treatment of physician's choice in women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine (BEACON): a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26482278)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.8), and "[Combining bempegaldesleukin (CD122-preferential IL-2 pathway agonist) and NKTR-262 (TLR7/8 agonist) improves systemic antitumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxicity over BEMPEG+RT.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35444059)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 1.78). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[NKTR](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000114857-NKTR) is an isomerase with rotamase activity, supported by evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, and cytosol. NKTR is expressed in neutrophils with unknown function (Cluster 21) and is involved in non-specific transcription processes in various tissues (Cluster 40). In the brain, it is associated with white matter and signal transduction (Cluster 11). Additionally, NKTR is involved in sensory perception in cell lines (Cluster 56) and non-specific transcription in single cells (Cluster 55).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), and [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886) and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.





The gene is expressed in the pituitary gland, as well as in various immune cell types, including CD34+, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells. Additionally, it shows expression in the pineal gland during both day and night cycles.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -1.414 (0.81 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 122.14 at pH 7.0 (99.95 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.024 (98.36 percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 26.54% helix (9.71 percentile), 20.66% sheet (2.49 percentile), and 38.37% turn (95.77 percentile). The instability index is 86.05 (99.0 percentile), with an isoelectric point of 10.01 (96.48 percentile).
