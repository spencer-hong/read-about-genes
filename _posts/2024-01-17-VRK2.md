The gene VRK2 (NCBI ID: 7444) has been mentioned in [32 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22VRK2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2012 and 2021. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning VRK2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Common variants at VRK2 and TCF4 conferring risk of schizophrenia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21791550)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 4.19), "[Identification of two novel human putative serine/threonine kinases, VRK1 and VRK2, with structural similarity to vaccinia virus B1R kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9344656)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 1.86), "[VRK2 is involved in the innate antiviral response by promoting mitostress-induced mtDNA release.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33785841)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.78), "[Human VRK2 modulates apoptosis by interaction with Bcl-xL and regulation of BAX gene expression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23449449)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.11), and "[Meta-analysis and brain imaging data support the involvement of VRK2 (rs2312147) in schizophrenia susceptibility.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23102693)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 1.08). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[VRK2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000028116-VRK2) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, functioning as a kinase. It is detected in all tissues at the RNA level and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. VRK2 is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 29 in blood, Cluster 35 in tissues, Cluster 11 in the brain, Cluster 26 in cell lines, and Cluster 51 in single cells, indicating its involvement in mitochondria, RNA binding, signal transduction, and oligodendrocytes. Evidence for VRK2 is established at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [RXRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6256), [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [TAF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872), and [PHF8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23133). Each of these TFs, except PHF8, was shown to be regulating in 5 experiments, while PHF8 was involved in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as mental health conditions like cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder.


The gene VRK2 has been associated with [Schizophrenia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27922604), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Schizophrenia](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012559) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including the salivary gland and blood. Additionally, it is found in 721_B_lymphoblasts, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, leukemia chronic myelogenous K-562 cells, CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, bronchial epithelial cells, and the pancreas.


The input data highlights several key processes involved in the cell cycle, particularly focusing on the dynamics of the nuclear envelope. These include the clearance of nuclear envelope membranes from chromatin, initiation of nuclear envelope reformation, and nuclear envelope reassembly. Additionally, the data covers various stages of mitosis, such as mitotic prophase, mitotic anaphase, and the broader mitotic metaphase and anaphase. Overall, the processes span the cell cycle, with a specific emphasis on the M phase and mitotic events.
