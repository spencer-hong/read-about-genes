[ST8SIA1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000111728-ST8SIA1) is a gene encoding a protein with glycosyltransferase and transferase molecular functions, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is notably expressed in neuronal and synaptic function clusters, as well as in skin cancer cell lines involved in extracellular matrix organization. In single-cell expression analysis, ST8SIA1 is found in neurons involved in neuronal signaling. The gene's expression in various cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and testicular germ cell tumor, is generally unprognostic.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), [GATA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2626), and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various metabolic disorders such as obesity, overnutrition, and inherited metabolic disorders. Cardiovascular issues are prominently featured, with links to coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and atherosclerosis. Additionally, the data highlights associations with kidney disease, urinary system disease, and several mental health conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and personality disorder. Musculoskeletal system diseases, such as myopathy and muscle tissue disease, are also implicated, along with fatty liver disease and lysosomal storage disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the bladder and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscle, atrioventricular node, and tongue.


The input data highlights various diseases and processes related to glycosylation, particularly asparagine N-linked glycosylation. Notably, defects in specific genes such as ALG2, ALG3, ALG6, ALG8, ALG9, DPAGT1, MAN1B1, MGAT2, MOGS, MPDU1, ALG1, ALG12, ALG11, ALG14, and RFT1 are associated with distinct congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) and other conditions like congenital myasthenic syndrome. Additionally, the data covers broader categories including diseases associated with N-glycosylation of proteins, post-translational protein modification, biosynthesis of the N-glycan precursor, synthesis of substrates in N-glycan biosynthesis, sialic acid metabolism, and general protein metabolism.
