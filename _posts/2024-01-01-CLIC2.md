The gene length is 920,286 base pairs (99.55% of all genes), the mature length is 6,466.5 base pairs (95.42% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 852,640 base pairs (99.82% of all genes).


The gene CLIC2, with NCBI ID 1193, has been the subject of [16 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CLIC2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2008 and 2017. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning CLIC2, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that explore various aspects of the gene's function and its implications in different biological contexts. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable publications include "[An X-linked channelopathy with cardiomegaly due to a CLIC2 mutation enhancing ryanodine receptor channel activity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22814392)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 2.16), "[A missense mutation in CLIC2 associated with intellectual disability is predicted by in silico modeling to affect protein stability and dynamics.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21630357)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 1.86), "[Structure of the Janus protein human CLIC2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17945253)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 1.49), "[CLIC-2 modulates cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15147738)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 1.48), and "[Chloride intracellular channel protein 2 in cancer and non-cancer human tissues: relationship with tight junctions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30929599)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 1.27).

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772), each with 5 experiments. Following closely are [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [DPF2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5977) was found to be regulating in 3 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.518 (33.1% percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -5.24 (33.05% percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.008 (76.2% percentile). The protein has a notable affinity for helix (36.84%, 84.59% percentile) and sheet (36.03%, 66.48% percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (28.34%, 50.35% percentile). The instability index is 43.95 (35.47% percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.44 (16.83% percentile). The protein is 247 amino acids long (21.24% percentile) with a molecular weight of 28356.05 Da (22.36% percentile).
