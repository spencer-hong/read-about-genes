The gene length is 9,657 base pairs (25th percentile), the mature length is 2,055.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 6,379 base pairs.


The gene FABP3 (NCBI ID: 2170) has been mentioned in [310 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FABP3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1988, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2017.


The top five publications mentioning FABP3, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Electrochemical immunosensor development based on core-shell high-crystalline graphitic carbon nitride@carbon dots and Cd<sub>0.5</sub>Zn<sub>0.5</sub>S/d-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene composite for heart-type fatty acid-binding protein detection.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33959811)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 6.28), "[Release of heart fatty acid-binding protein into plasma after acute myocardial infarction in man.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1480144)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 6.13), "[Ascorbic acid-mediated organic photoelectrochemical transistor sensing strategy for highly sensitive detection of heart-type fatty acid binding protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996003)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 3.94), "[A highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for h-FABP determination based on self-enhanced luminophore coupled with ultrathin 2D nickel metal-organic framework nanosheets.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33075723)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 3.82), and "[Structural studies on human muscle fatty acid binding protein at 1.4 A resolution: binding interactions with three C18 fatty acids.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7922029)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 3.1). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[FABP3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000121769-FABP3) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many tissues. It is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and focal adhesion sites. The gene is highly expressed in heart muscle, where it is involved in cardiac muscle contraction, and in neurons, where it plays a mixed functional role. Additionally, FABP3 is expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines, breast glandular cells during lactation, and various other tissues and cell types.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.
