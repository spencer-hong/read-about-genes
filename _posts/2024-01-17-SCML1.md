The gene enables [chromatin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003682) and [histone binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042393), is active in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), and is involved in the [negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045892).


The gene length is 45,582 base pairs (63.89% of all genes), the mature length is 3,055 base pairs (73.27% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 40,366.5 base pairs (70.17% of all genes).


SCML1 has been mentioned in [3 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SCML1%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2012.


The top publications mentioning SCML1 include "[Characterization of SCML1, a new gene in Xp22, with homology to developmental polycomb genes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9570953)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 0.49), "[Adaptive evolution of SCML1 in primates, a gene involved in male reproduction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18601738)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 0.19), and "[The enigmatic meiotic dense body and its newly discovered component, SCML1, are dispensable for fertility and gametogenesis in mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27165042)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 0.08). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SCML1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000047634-SCML1) is a repressor protein with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissues and is primarily located in the nucleoplasm. SCML1 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 3 for blood (non-specific nuclear processes), Cluster 39 for tissue (retina and testis, associated with cilium), Cluster 37 for brain (neurons with mixed function), Cluster 36 for cell lines (non-specific mRNA processing), and Cluster 79 for single cells (spermatocytes and spermatogonia, involved in spermatogenesis).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) each with 5 experiments, and [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) each with 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in nerve and ovary tissues according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in pineal gland (night), CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, fetal liver, and various testis cell types including interstitial, Leydig, and germ cells.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.592 (26.04th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -2.575 (40.94th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.006 (67.65th percentile), with a predicted secondary structure composition of 29.79% helix (30.1st percentile), 34.95% sheet (58.83rd percentile), and 31.31% turn (72.64th percentile). The instability index is 54.96 (72.1st percentile), suggesting potential instability. The isoelectric point is 6.42 (40.85th percentile), with a molecular weight of 37446.86 Da (35.73rd percentile). The sequence length is 329 amino acids (34.55th percentile).
