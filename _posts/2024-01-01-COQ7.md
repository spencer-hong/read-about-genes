The gene length is 697,948 base pairs (99.13% of all genes), the mature length is 3,115 base pairs (74.06% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 686,064 base pairs (99.63% of all genes).


The gene COQ7, with NCBI ID 10229, has been the subject of [11 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22COQ7%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 2001, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning COQ7, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mitochondrial COQ9 is a lipid-binding protein that associates with COQ7 to enable coenzyme Q biosynthesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25339443)" (2014) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 3.38, "[Rescue of primary ubiquinone deficiency due to a novel COQ7 defect using 2,4-dihydroxybensoic acid.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26084283)" (2015) with an RCR of 2.93, "[Pathogenicity of two COQ7 mutations and responses to 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate bypass treatment.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28409910)" (2017) with an RCR of 2.23, "[A nuclear role for the respiratory enzyme CLK-1 in regulating mitochondrial stress responses and longevity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25961505)" (2015) with an RCR of 1.94, and "[A fatal case of <i>COQ7</i>-associated primary coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> deficiency.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31240163)" (2019) with an RCR of 1.67. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733) with 6 experiments, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 5 experiments, [KLF5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/688) with 5 experiments, [KDM6A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7403) with 5 experiments, and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 12850 and its human ortholog gene 10229 exhibit complete penetrance preweaning lethality in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.187 (70.52 percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 3.12 (61.69 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.993 (16.14 percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (37.79%, 88.04 percentile) and a moderate affinity for sheet structures (33.18%, 46.52 percentile), with a lower affinity for turn structures (23.04%, 10.15 percentile). The instability index is 50.93 (60.25 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.77 (73.03 percentile). The protein sequence is 217 amino acids long (17.03 percentile) with a molecular weight of 24276.74 Da (17.07 percentile).
