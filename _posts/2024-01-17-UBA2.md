The gene length is 57,108 base pairs (69.82% of all genes), the mature length is 3,167.5 base pairs (74.83% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 49,265 base pairs (74.86% of all genes).


The gene UBA2 (NCBI ID: 10054) has been mentioned in [29 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22UBA2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2014 and 2020. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning UBA2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Polymeric chains of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are conjugated to protein substrates by SAE1/SAE2 and Ubc9.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11451954)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 10.64), "[The ubiquitin-like protein Smt3p is activated for conjugation to other proteins by an Aos1p/Uba2p heterodimer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9312010)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 7.52), "[Molecular cloning and characterization of human AOS1 and UBA2, components of the sentrin-activating enzyme complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10217437)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 2.17), "[Increased SUMO-activating enzyme SAE1/UBA2 promotes glycolysis and pathogenic behavior of rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938830)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.66), and "[Knockdown of SUMO-activating enzyme subunit 2 (SAE2) suppresses cancer malignancy and enhances chemotherapy sensitivity in small cell lung cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26063074)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.23). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[UBA2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000126261-UBA2) is a transferase involved in disease variants of ectodermal dysplasia. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. It is part of Cluster 3 for blood expression, indicating involvement in nuclear processes, and Cluster 4 for tissue expression, suggesting a role in basic cellular processes in the testis. In the brain and cell line expression clusters, it is associated with non-specific transcription processes. Additionally, UBA2 is found in Cluster 48 for single-cell expression, indicating its presence in smooth muscle cells involved in signal transduction.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), and [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, cerebrovascular disease, and general disease of anatomical entities.



The gene is expressed in adipose tissue and blood vessels according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in various cancer types, including Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), and colorectal adenocarcinoma, as well as in the uterus.


The input data highlights several key pathways involving post-translational protein modification, particularly focusing on SUMOylation. This includes the metabolism of proteins, the processing and activation of SUMO, and the conjugation of SUMO to E1 (UBA2:SAE1). Additionally, the data indicates the transfer of SUMO from E1 to E2 (UBE2I, UBC9).


The mouse ortholog gene 50995 and its human ortholog gene 10054 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.
