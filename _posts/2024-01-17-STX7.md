[STX7](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000079950-STX7) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in lysosomes and is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including dendritic cells, lymphoid tissue, oligodendrocytes, skin cancer cell lines, and B-cells. The gene's expression is associated with immune response, mixed function, melanin biosynthesis, and B-cell function. However, it is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024) and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.


The transcription factor [GATA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) was found to be regulating genes in one Perturb-seq experiment, according to data from GTRD's database of transcription factor binding sites and the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).


The input data indicates associations with a variety of disease conditions, including several types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are noted. The data also highlights hematopoietic and immune system diseases, as well as cardiovascular system disease. Furthermore, mental health disorders, specifically substance-related disorders and alcohol dependence, are included in the dataset.



The gene is expressed in nerve and spleen tissues according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in various immune cell types, including CD34+, CD33+ myeloid cells, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD14+ monocytes, as well as in whole blood and fetal brain.



The mouse ortholog gene 53331 and its human ortholog gene 8417 are associated with abnormal thymus morphology and small thymus phenotypes, observed in both sexes.
