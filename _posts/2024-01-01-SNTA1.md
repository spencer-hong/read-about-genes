The gene length is 445,727 base pairs (97.9% of all genes), with a mature length of 3,267 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 445,727 base pairs.


The gene SNTA1, with NCBI ID 6640, has been featured in [21 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SNTA1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2009 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning SNTA1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Stress-activated protein kinase-3 interacts with the PDZ domain of alpha1-syntrophin. A mechanism for specific substrate recognition.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10212242)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 2.46), "[<i>SNTA1</i> gene rescues ion channel function and is antiarrhythmic in cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from muscular dystrophy patients.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35762211)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 2.25), "[Nav1.5 N-terminal domain binding to Î±1-syntrophin increases membrane density of human Kir2.1, Kir2.2 and Nav1.5 channels.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26786162)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 2.16), "[alpha-1-syntrophin mutation and the long-QT syndrome: a disease of sodium channel disruption.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19684871)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 1.93), and "[Alpha1-syntrophin modulates turnover of ABCA1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14722086)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 1.9). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[Actin-binding, Calmodulin-binding](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) is a gene with molecular functions in actin-binding and calmodulin-binding. It has been implicated in disease variants and Long QT syndrome. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is expressed in various clusters, including B-cells - Immunoglobulins in blood, Non-specific - Cellular respiration in tissues, Astrocytes - Mixed function in the brain, Non-specific - Transcription in cell lines, and Smooth muscle cells - Muscle contraction in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149) with 5 experiments, [KLF5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/688) with 4 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 4 experiments, and [MITF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4286) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.240 (65th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature.
