The gene has a length of 85,084 base pairs (78.64% of all genes), a mature length of 1,783 base pairs, and a primary transcript length of 81,492.5 base pairs.


The gene NCAM2 (NCBI ID: 4685) has been mentioned in [13 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22NCAM2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning NCAM2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The Hidden Side of NCAM Family: NCAM2, a Key Cytoskeleton Organization Molecule Regulating Multiple Neural Functions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34576185)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.62), "[Neural cell adhesion molecule 2 promotes the formation of filopodia and neurite branching by inducing submembrane increases in Ca2+ levels.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25632147)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.29), "[NCAM2 Regulates Dendritic and Axonal Differentiation through the Cytoskeletal Proteins MAP2 and 14-3-3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32043120)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.15), "[NCAM2/OCAM/RNCAM: cell adhesion molecule with a role in neuronal compartmentalization.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22155300)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 1.13), and "[Cloning of a novel human neural cell adhesion molecule gene (NCAM2) that maps to chromosome region 21q21 and is potentially involved in Down syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9226371)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 1.12). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[NCAM2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154654-NCAM2) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in nuclear bodies and the plasma membrane. NCAM2 is highly expressed in brain tissues, specifically in neurons involved in synaptic function, and is also found in prostate cancer cell lines. In single-cell expression analysis, it clusters with neurons involved in neuronal signaling. While NCAM2 is unprognostic for several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, its role in neuronal signaling and brain function is notable.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments, followed by [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624), [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), each with 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including respiratory disorders such as asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, and lower respiratory tract disease. Metabolic conditions are also prominent, with links to diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Cardiovascular issues are represented by coronary artery disease, vascular disease, and cardiovascular system disease. Neurological and mental health conditions include neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, cognitive disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Additionally, the data highlights associations with eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinal degeneration, as well as musculoskeletal system diseases and genetic conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and monogenic diseases.



The gene is expressed in various neural tissues, including nerve and brain, as well as the adrenal gland. Additionally, it is expressed in cardiac myocytes, heart, liver, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, and skeletal muscle. Notably, it is also expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji) cells.
