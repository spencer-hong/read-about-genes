The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [angiogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001525), [placenta development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001890), and [heart morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003007). It plays a role in the regulation of protein phosphorylation, both generally and positively, as seen in [regulation of protein phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001932) and [positive regulation of protein phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001934). The gene enables several molecular functions, such as [actin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003779), [protein tyrosine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004713), and [protein tyrosine phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004725). It is located in multiple cellular components, including the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [centrosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005813), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005856), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). Additionally, the gene is active in and located in [focal adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005925) and [cell cortex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005938). It is also involved in various signaling pathways, including the [epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007173) and the [transforming growth factor beta receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007179). The gene's functions extend to the regulation of cell migration, cell shape, and cell population proliferation, as well as the establishment of cell polarity and the regulation of cell adhesion.


The gene length is 35,105 base pairs (56.99% of all genes), the mature length is 1,336 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 35,105 base pairs.

[PTK2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000169398-PTK2) is a developmental protein with kinase, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase molecular functions. It is implicated in cancer-related genes and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in vesicles, focal adhesion sites, primary cilium, primary cilium tip, and cytosol. PTK2 is expressed in B-cells with unknown function (Cluster 34) and shows non-specific mixed function tissue expression (Cluster 34). In the brain, it is involved in signal transduction in white matter (Cluster 11), and in single cells, it is associated with neuronal signaling in neurons (Cluster 34).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 7 experiments, [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 6 experiments, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 6 experiments, [TAF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872) with 6 experiments, and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 6 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.
