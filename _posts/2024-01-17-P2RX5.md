[P2RX5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000083454-P2RX5) is a gene that functions as an ion channel and a ligand-gated ion channel receptor. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in the plasma membrane and cytosol. The gene is expressed in B-cells with unknown function and is involved in immune response in lymphoid tissue, mixed function in neurons, and immune response in lymphoma cell lines. Single-cell expression data indicates its role in B-cell function. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 6 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 4 experiments, [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 4 experiments, and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various metabolic and nutritional conditions, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, nutrition diseases, overnutrition, and obesity.
