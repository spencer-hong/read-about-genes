[TRIO](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000038382-TRIO) is a multifunctional gene encoding a protein with guanine-nucleotide releasing factor, kinase, serine/threonine-protein kinase, and transferase activities. It is implicated in various diseases, including cancer and intellectual disability. The protein is detected in all tissues and is localized to vesicles, the plasma membrane, primary cilium, primary cilium tip, basal body, and cytosol. TRIO is highly expressed in smooth muscle tissue, where it is involved in ECM organization, and in astrocytes, contributing to astrocyte-neuron interactions. Additionally, it is expressed in neurons, playing a role in neuronal signaling.
