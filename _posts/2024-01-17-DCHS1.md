Furthermore, it is involved in [digestive tract development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048565), [condensed mesenchymal cell proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0072137), [protein localization to plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0072659), and [cochlea development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0090102). Lastly, it plays a role in [cell-cell adhesion via plasma-membrane adhesion molecules](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0098742).


The gene length is 12,325 base pairs (30.21% of all genes), the mature length is 2,079 base pairs (54.83% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 12,241 base pairs (38.68% of all genes).


The gene DCHS1 (NCBI ID: 8642) has been mentioned in [12 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DCHS1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1994 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2006 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning DCHS1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mutations in genes encoding the cadherin receptor-ligand pair DCHS1 and FAT4 disrupt cerebral cortical development.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24056717)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 4.7), "[Regulation of neuronal migration by Dchs1-Fat4 planar cell polarity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998526)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 1.39), "[Dchs1-Fat4 regulation of polarized cell behaviours during skeletal morphogenesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27145737)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 1.08), "[Dchs1-Fat4 regulation of osteogenic differentiation in mouse.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31358536)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 0.94), and "[DCHS1, Lix1L, and the Septin Cytoskeleton: Molecular and Developmental Etiology of Mitral Valve Prolapse.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35200715)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 0.87). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[DCHS1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000166341-DCHS1) is a gene implicated in various diseases, including deafness, disease variants, and intellectual disability. Evidence for its involvement is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized to the plasma membrane. Its expression is notable in smooth muscle tissue, where it is involved in extracellular matrix organization, and in astrocytes, where it plays a role in astrocyte-neuron interactions. Additionally, DCHS1 is expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines, involved in neuronal signaling, and in adipocytes and endothelial cells, where it has mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments, [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) and [PRDM9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/56979) each with 3 experiments, and [RBBP5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5929) and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) each with 2 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and broader cardiovascular system diseases. Additionally, the data highlights links to various nervous system diseases, such as central nervous system diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and cognitive disorders. Specific conditions mentioned include bipolar disorder, mood disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, motor neuron disease, sleep disorder, and narcolepsy.


The genome-wide association study has identified a link between DCHS1 and [Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 50 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354), with the closest MeSH match being [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506). This association was determined using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus, fetal brain, atrioventricular node, uterus corpus, ovary, fetal lung, and uterus.
