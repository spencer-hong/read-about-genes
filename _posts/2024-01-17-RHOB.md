[RHOB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000143878-RHOB) is a developmental protein with evidence at the protein level, implicated in cancer-related genes as a tumor suppressor. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in smooth muscle tissue and astrocytes, where it is involved in ECM organization and mixed functions, respectively. In blood, it is associated with non-specific innate immune response. Additionally, RHOB is expressed in breast cancer cell lines, although its function in this context is unknown.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CHD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1106) with 5 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 4 experiments, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 4 experiments, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) with 4 experiments, and [ELF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1997) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the blood vessel, fallopian tube, and cervix uteri, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the spinal cord, adrenal cortex, adrenal gland, uterus corpus, ovary, and olfactory bulb.


The proteins are involved in various pathways, including the GPVI-mediated activation cascade, axon guidance, and developmental biology. They also participate in semaphorin signaling, specifically Sema4D-induced cell migration and growth-cone collapse, as well as general semaphorin interactions. Additionally, these proteins play roles in G alpha (12/13) signaling events, the Rho GTPase cycle, and signaling by Rho GTPases. They are also implicated in GPCR downstream signaling, signaling by GPCR, and broader signal transduction processes. Furthermore, the proteins are involved in hemostasis and platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation.
