The gene enables [DNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003677) and [mRNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003729), and functions as an [endopeptidase inhibitor](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004866), specifically a [serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004867). It also enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [enzyme binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019899). The gene is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), [specific granule lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035580), and [collagen-containing extracellular matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0062023), and is active in the extracellular space. It is involved in various processes including [immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006955), [antibacterial humoral response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019731), [negative regulation of protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032091), [response to lipopolysaccharide](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032496), [modulation of process of another organism](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035821), [negative regulation of viral genome replication](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045071), and [innate immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045087). Additionally, the gene is found in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062).


The gene length is 187,490 base pairs (91.71% of all genes), the mature length is 2,720 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 134,011.5 base pairs.


The gene SLPI (NCBI ID: 6590) has been mentioned in [285 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLPI%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1967, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2014.


The top 5 publications mentioning SLPI, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[ALK1 and p80 expression and chromosomal rearrangements involving 2p23 in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11406658)" (2001) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 10.16, "[High IFN-Î³ and low SLPI mark severe asthma in mice and humans.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26121748)" (2015) with an RCR of 9.29, "[Detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK proteins in normal and neoplastic cells with the monoclonal antibody ALK1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9028963)" (1997) with an RCR of 8.38, "[The alk-1-enyl group content of mammalian myelin phosphoglycerides by quantitative two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4973039)" (1968) with an RCR of 6.65, and "[Expression of ALK1 and p80 in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and its mesenchymal mimics: a study of 135 cases.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12218210)" (2002) with an RCR of 5.95. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SLPI](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000124107-SLPI) is a gene with multiple molecular functions, including antibiotic, antimicrobial, protease inhibitor, and serine protease inhibitor activities. It is involved in cancer-related processes and has evidence at the protein level. SLPI is detected in many tissues and is localized to the Golgi apparatus. Its expression is associated with neutrophil degranulation in blood, extracellular exosomes in epithelial tissues, mitochondria in the choroid plexus of the brain, membrane components in kidney cancer cell lines, and respiratory epithelial cells of unknown function in single-cell analyses.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) and [KLF4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9314), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [INTS11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54973), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), and [HNF4A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3172) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the cervix uteri and salivary gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the lung, salivary gland, trachea, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, atrioventricular node, and tongue.
