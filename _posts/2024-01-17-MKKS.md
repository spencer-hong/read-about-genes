The gene is also involved in processes such as [melanosome transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032402), [developmental process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032502), and [social behavior](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035176).


The gene length is 116,321 base pairs (84.61% of all genes), the mature length is 2,265 base pairs (59.08% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 73,566 base pairs (83.33% of all genes).


The gene MKKS (NCBI ID: 8195) has been mentioned in [19 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MKKS%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1988 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2001 and 2017. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning MKKS, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows. The most influential publication is "[BBS6, BBS10, and BBS12 form a complex with CCT/TRiC family chaperonins and mediate BBSome assembly.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20080638)" (2010) with an RCR of 5.37. This is followed by "[Mutations in MKKS cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10973238)" (2000) with an RCR of 3.49. Additionally, "[Heterozygous mutations in BBS1, BBS2 and BBS6 have a potential epistatic effect on Bardet-Biedl patients with two mutations at a second BBS locus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12837689)" (2003) has an RCR of 2.74. More recently, "[Bardet-Biedl syndrome: The pleiotropic role of the chaperonin-like BBS6, 10, and 12 proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35373910)" (2022) achieved an RCR of 2.34, and "[Bardet-Biedl Syndrome as a Chaperonopathy: Dissecting the Major Role of Chaperonin-Like BBS Proteins (BBS6-BBS10-BBS12).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28824921)" (2017) has an RCR of 2.09.

[MKKS](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000125863-MKKS) is a gene that functions as a chaperone and is implicated in various diseases, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome, ciliopathy, intellectual disability, and obesity. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues and is localized to the centrosome and basal body. Its expression is associated with cell proliferation in blood, cellular respiration in tissues, mixed function in the brain, plasma proteins in cell lines, and transcription in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [STAT5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6777), [ELF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1997), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [CDK8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1024), and [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including various metabolic disorders such as diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism disease, and glucose metabolism disease, notably diabetes mellitus. Additionally, associations were found with cardiovascular system disease, kidney disease, urinary system disease, nervous system disease, and eye diseases, including retinal disease. Furthermore, the data highlights links to female reproductive system disease, specifically endometriosis.



The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, cingulate cortex, temporal lobe, medulla oblongata, occipital lobe, and globus pallidus, as well as in CD14+ monocytes. Additionally, it is expressed in the pituitary and kidney.


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in ciliary function and organelle dynamics. These include the assembly of the primary cilium, organelle biogenesis and maintenance, BBSome-mediated cargo-targeting to the cilium, and cargo trafficking to the periciliary membrane. These processes are crucial for the proper functioning and regulation of cellular organelles, particularly the primary cilium.
