The gene SCP2 (NCBI ID: 6342) has been mentioned in [86 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SCP2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1980 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1995 and 2007. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning SCP2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Purification and properties of sterol carrier protein2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7372677)" (1980) (relative citation ratio: 7.99), "[Gene structure, intracellular localization, and functional roles of sterol carrier protein-2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11591437)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 3.9), "[Cloning and expression of a cDNA encoding human sterol carrier protein 2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1703300)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 3.25), "[Sterol carrier protein-2, a new fatty acyl coenzyme A-binding protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8943231)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 3.09), and "[Sterol carrier protein-2 is involved in cholesterol transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in human fibroblasts.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7642518)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 3.02). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SCP2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000116171-SCP2) is a gene encoding a protein with acyltransferase and transferase molecular functions, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is expressed in all tissues, with notable expression in the liver and intestine, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism. Subcellularly, the protein is localized to the nucleoplasm and peroxisomes. In the brain, the gene is involved in general metabolism, while in cell lines, it is associated with mRNA processing. Single-cell expression data indicate that SCP2 is particularly active in hepatocytes, further emphasizing its role in metabolism.

The transcription factor [TCF7L2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) was found to be regulating gene expression in one Perturb-seq experiment, according to data from GTRD's database of transcription factor binding sites and the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).


The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of mental health diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and colon, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in adipocytes, the colon, the small intestine, and fetal liver.


The proteins are involved in various metabolic pathways, including beta-oxidation of pristanoyl-CoA, peroxisomal lipid metabolism, alpha-linolenic (omega3) and linoleic (omega6) acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) metabolism, general metabolism, metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins, bile acid and bile salt metabolism, synthesis of bile acids and bile salts, and synthesis of bile acids and bile salts via 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol.
