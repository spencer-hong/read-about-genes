The gene is involved in [cell morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000902) and [neuron projection development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031175), as well as the [negative regulation of tubulin deacetylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1904428). It is located in the [spindle pole](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000922) and [centrosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005813), and is active in the [cell cortex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005938) and [site of polarized growth](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030427). Additionally, it enables [enzyme inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004857).


The gene length is 26,724 base pairs (49.52% of all genes), the mature length is 2,316 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 24,128 base pairs (56.92% of all genes).


The gene FRY (NCBI ID: 10129) has been mentioned in [16 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FRY%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning FRY was in 1930, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning FRY, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include "[Responses by fishes to environmental hypoxia: integration through Fry's concept of aerobic metabolic scope.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26768976)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 7.4), "[Vocal fry may undermine the success of young women in the labor market.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24870387)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 1.58), "[Furry promotes acetylation of microtubules in the mitotic spindle by inhibition of SIRT2 tubulin deacetylase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23886946)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.17), "[Vocal Fry and Vowel Height in Simulated Room Acoustics.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29462822)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 0.83), and "[Furry protein promotes aurora A-mediated Polo-like kinase 1 activation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22753416)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 0.62).

[FRY](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000073910-FRY) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in heart muscle, where it is involved in cardiac muscle contraction. In the brain, it shows non-specific DNA binding activity, while in cell lines, it is associated with myeloid leukemia and innate immune response. At the single-cell level, FRY is involved in neuronal synaptic function. Additionally, it is expressed in eosinophils, contributing to transcription processes. However, FRY is unprognostic in various cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, ovary serous cystadenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, testicular germ cell tumor, and thyroid carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) with 5 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 5 experiments, [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 5 experiments, and [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149) with 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as male reproductive organ cancer, prostate cancer, hematologic cancer, immune system cancer, lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Additionally, metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and carbohydrate metabolism disease are highlighted. Mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance dependence, are also noted. Furthermore, the data includes cardiovascular system diseases, kidney disease, and sleep disorders like narcolepsy.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood vessel and bladder, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in pineal gland during the day, prefrontal cortex, CD33+ myeloid cells, amygdala, fetal brain, and lung.
