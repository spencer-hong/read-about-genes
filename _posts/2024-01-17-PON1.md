The gene PON1 (NCBI ID: 5444) has been mentioned in [1,526 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PON1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning PON1 is 1953, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2016.


The top 5 publications mentioning PON1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Paraoxonase prevents accumulation of lipoperoxides in low-density lipoprotein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1650712)" (1991) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 22.86, "[Purification of human serum paraoxonase/arylesterase. Evidence for one esterase catalyzing both activities.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1673382)" (1991) with an RCR of 17.52, "[Human paraoxonases (PON1, PON2, and PON3) are lactonases with overlapping and distinct substrate specificities.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15772423)" (2005) with an RCR of 12.51, "[Paraoxonase-1 is a major determinant of clopidogrel efficacy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21170047)" (2011) with an RCR of 11.92, and "[Prenatal exposure to organophosphates, paraoxonase 1, and cognitive development in childhood.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21507778)" (2011) with an RCR of 10.65. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[PON1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000005421-PON1) is a hydrolase involved in cancer-related genes, with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, and it is notably expressed in the liver, cerebellum, and leukemia T-cell receptor cell lines. The gene is particularly active in hepatocytes, where it plays a role in metabolism. While PON1 is unprognostic for several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, its expression patterns suggest a significant role in various biological processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including renal artery disease, various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular conditions like coronary artery disease, heart disease, and myocardial infarction. Additionally, the data highlights musculoskeletal system diseases, including arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as bone inflammation disease.


The PON1 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [aspartate aminotransferase, cytoplasmic levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36168886), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Aspartic Acid](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001224) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, PON1 is associated with [sulfiredoxin-1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354), closely related to the MeSH term [Thioredoxins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013879), and [testis-expressed sequence 29 protein levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354), which maps to the MeSH term [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506). These associations highlight the diverse roles of PON1 in various biological processes.


The gene is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the liver, pituitary, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, heart, liver, parietal lobe, fetal liver, skeletal muscle, and thymus, suggesting a ubiquitous expression pattern across multiple tissue samples.
