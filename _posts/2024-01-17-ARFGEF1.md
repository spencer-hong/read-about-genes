[ARFGEF1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000066777-ARFGEF1) is a guanine-nucleotide releasing factor with evidence at the protein level. It is implicated in several diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in the nucleoplasm, Golgi apparatus, and cytosol. ARFGEF1 is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 3 for blood expression related to nuclear processes, Cluster 39 for tissue expression in the retina and testis related to cilium function, Cluster 50 for brain expression related to nucleic acid binding, Cluster 40 for cell line expression with unknown function, and Cluster 55 for single cell expression related to transcription.
