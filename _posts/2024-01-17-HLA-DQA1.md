[HLA-DQA1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196735-HLA-DQA1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many RNA tissue distributions. It is expressed in dendritic cells with an unknown function in the blood, and in lymphoid tissue involved in cytokine signaling. In the brain, it is associated with non-specific metabolism, while in cell lines, it is linked to lymphoma and adaptive immune response. Single-cell expression analysis places it in dendritic cells involved in antigen presentation. The gene is unprognostic for various cancers, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma, among others.
