The gene is involved in various biological processes, including the [innate immune response in mucosa](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002227), [chemotaxis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006935), and [immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006955). It plays a role in [T cell chemotaxis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010818) and the [antibacterial humoral response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019731). Additionally, it is involved in the [intracellular estrogen receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030520) and the [killing of cells of another organism](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031640). The gene is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), [Golgi lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005796), [azurophil granule lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035578), and [collagen-containing extracellular matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0062023). It also colocalizes with the [collagen-containing extracellular matrix](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0062023) and is located in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [pore-forming activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0140911). Furthermore, it is involved in defense responses to various pathogens, including protozoa, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and viruses. It also plays a role in the [disruption of plasma membrane integrity in another organism](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051673) and the [killing by host of symbiont cells](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051873). Lastly, the gene is involved in the [antimicrobial humoral immune response mediated by antimicrobial peptide](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0061844) and the [cellular response to lipopolysaccharide](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071222).


The gene length is 9,315 base pairs (24.19% of all genes), the mature length is 1,095 base pairs (25.73% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 6,423 base pairs (23.35% of all genes).


The gene DEFA1 (NCBI ID: 1667) has been mentioned in [30 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DEFA1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1987 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2002 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning DEFA1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11242053)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 32.88), "[SETDB1: a novel KAP-1-associated histone H3, lysine 9-specific methyltransferase that contributes to HP1-mediated silencing of euchromatic genes by KRAB zinc-finger proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11959841)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 13.81), "[Rb targets histone H3 methylation and HP1 to promoters.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11484059)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 10.6), "[Bee-derived antibacterial peptide, defensin-1, promotes wound re-epithelialisation in vitro and in vivo.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28779102)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 2.86), and "[Copy number polymorphism and expression level variation of the human alpha-defensin genes DEFA1 and DEFA3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15944200)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 2.82). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[DEFA1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000206047-DEFA1) is a gene with multiple molecular functions, including antibiotic, antimicrobial, defensin, and fungicide activities. It is involved in cancer-related processes and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 21 in neutrophils with unknown function, Cluster 6 in bone marrow related to innate immune response, Cluster 47 in endothelial cells related to vasculature, Cluster 14 in myeloid leukemia related to innate immune response, and Cluster 7 in T-cells related to T-cell receptor. The gene is unprognostic for Glioblastoma Multiforme and Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [ZFX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7543), and [SNAI2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6591), each shown to be regulating in one experiment.





The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung, blood, and spleen.


The input data highlights several key components of the immune system, specifically focusing on alpha-defensins and defensins, which are integral parts of the innate immune system. These proteins play crucial roles in the broader immune system, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms.



The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.285 (91.98th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -0.457 (48.4th percentile).
