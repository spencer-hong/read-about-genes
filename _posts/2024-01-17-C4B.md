The gene length is 1,173,676.0 base pairs (99.76% of all genes), the mature length is 1,825.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 861,116.5 base pairs (99.82% of all genes).


The gene C4B (NCBI ID: 721) has been mentioned in [203 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22C4B%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning C4B is 1975, with the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1988 and 2005.


The top five publications mentioning C4B, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Family study of the major histocompatibility complex in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: importance of null alleles of C4A and C4B in determining disease susceptibility](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6401549)" (1983) (relative citation ratio: 10.44), "[Human C4-binding protein. II. Role in proteolysis of C4b by C3b-inactivator](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/702059)" (1978) (relative citation ratio: 9.22), "[Complement system proteins which interact with C3b or C4b A superfamily of structurally related proteins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25290405)" (1986) (relative citation ratio: 6.27), "[Visualization of human C4b-binding protein and its complexes with vitamin K-dependent protein S and complement protein C4b](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6222381)" (1983) (relative citation ratio: 5.26), and "[Targeting C3b/C4b and VEGF with a bispecific fusion protein optimized for neovascular age-related macular degeneration therapy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35648811)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 4.76). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[C4B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000224389-C4B) is a gene with a molecular function as a blood group antigen. It is involved in systemic lupus erythematosus and is an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the liver, where it is associated with metabolism (Cluster 83). In the brain, it is expressed in astrocytes with mixed functions (Cluster 39). Additionally, it is expressed in the DU4475 cell line (Cluster 70) and in hepatocytes involved in metabolism (Cluster 62).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [AGO2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/27161), and [RBFOX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23543), each shown to be regulating in one experiment.





The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the liver and adrenal gland.


The input data highlights several pathways related to the immune system, including the innate immune system, activation of C3 and C5, regulation of the complement cascade, initial triggering of complement, and the complement cascade itself.
