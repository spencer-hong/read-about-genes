The gene JAK1 (NCBI ID: 3716) has been mentioned in [485 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22JAK1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning JAK1 is 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2020.


The top five publications mentioning JAK1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Safety and efficacy of INCB018424, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, in myelofibrosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20843246)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 20.16), "[Association of transcription factor APRF and protein kinase Jak1 with the interleukin-6 signal transducer gp130](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8272872)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 14.37), "[Itaconate and itaconate derivatives target JAK1 to suppress alternative activation of macrophages](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35235776)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 14.35), "[JAK1/2 inhibition with baricitinib in the treatment of autoinflammatory interferonopathies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29649002)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 13.63), and "[The protein tyrosine kinase JAK1 complements defects in interferon-alpha/beta and -gamma signal transduction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8232552)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 13.43). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[JAK1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000162434-JAK1) is a kinase with transferase and tyrosine-protein kinase molecular functions. It is involved in cancer-related processes and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. JAK1 is detected in all tissues and is particularly expressed in NK-cells, contributing to the adaptive immune response. It is also associated with cell proliferation and basic cellular processes, with notable expression in the choroid plexus and mitochondria, as well as in kidney cancer membrane components.
