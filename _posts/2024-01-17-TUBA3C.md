The gene is involved in [microtubule cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000226) and the [mitotic cell cycle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000278). It enables [structural constituent of cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005200) and [GTP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005525), as well as [hydrolase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016787) and [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872). The gene is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [microtubule cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015630), and [ciliary basal body](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0036064). It is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and [microtubule](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005874). Additionally, the gene is involved in [male germ-line stem cell population maintenance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0036098).


The gene length is 8,645 base pairs (22.73rd percentile), the mature length is 5,568 base pairs (92.67th percentile), and the primary transcript length is 8,645 base pairs (29.7th percentile).


The gene TUBA3C, with NCBI Gene ID 7278, has been mentioned in [1 publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TUBA3C%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications range from 1998 to 1998.


The top publication mentioning TUBA3C is "[Sequence characterization of a newly identified human alpha-tubulin gene (TUBA2)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9465305)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 0.09). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TUBA3C](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198033-TUBA3C) is a gene with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. It is primarily located in microtubules and the primary cilium. The gene's RNA is detected in single cells, and its expression is notably clustered in testis, specifically in spermatid development (Cluster 10). Additionally, TUBA3C is expressed in lymphoma cell lines, clustering in adaptive immune response (Cluster 21), and in single cells, particularly in spermatocytes involved in spermatogenesis (Cluster 31). The gene is unprognostic in several cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma (validation), Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Skin Cutaneous Melanoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma, and Testicular Germ Cell Tumor.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 3 experiments, and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), and [E2F6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1876), each with 2 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, arteriosclerosis, arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, mineral metabolism disease, and calcium metabolism disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including breast, stomach, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, Temporal Lobe, Testis, Testis Interstitial, Testis Leydig Cell, Testis Seminiferous Tubule, and Testis Germ Cell.


The input data highlights several pathways involved in protein metabolism and folding. These include general metabolism of proteins, chaperonin-mediated protein folding, and specific processes such as the cooperation of Prefoldin and TriC/CCT in actin and tubulin folding. Additionally, the data covers Prefoldin-mediated transfer of substrates to CCT/TriC, the formation of tubulin folding intermediates by CCT/TriC, and the post-chaperonin tubulin folding pathway.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.185 (70.72 percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -22.39 (9.63 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.996 (22.99 percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 30.67% (37.75 percentile), 36.89% (72.3 percentile), and 26.22% (31.18 percentile), respectively. The instability index is 34.93 (10.02 percentile), with an isoelectric point of 4.98 (7.27 percentile). The protein is 450 amino acids long (51.87 percentile) and has a molecular weight of 49958.98 Da (51.65 percentile).
