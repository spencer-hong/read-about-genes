The gene RYK, with NCBI ID 6259, has been mentioned in [51 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RYK%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning RYK is 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2017.


The top 5 publications mentioning RYK, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mammalian Ryk is a Wnt coreceptor required for stimulation of neurite outgrowth.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15454084)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 5.89), "[The role of Ryk and Ror receptor tyrosine kinases in Wnt signal transduction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24370848)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 3.92), "[The Wnt coreceptor Ryk regulates Wnt/planar cell polarity by modulating the degradation of the core planar cell polarity component Vangl2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23144463)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 2.3), "[Cleavage of the Wnt receptor Ryk regulates neuronal differentiation during cortical neurogenesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19000841)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 1.9), and "[Non-Canonical WNT5A Signaling Through RYK Contributes to Aggressive Phenotype of the Rheumatoid Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33178184)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.83). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[RYK](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000163785-RYK) is a gene encoding a protein with kinase, receptor, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase molecular functions. Evidence for this protein is available at the protein level. The RNA expression of RYK is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in connective tissue involved in ECM organization, neurons involved in neuronal signaling, and non-specific tissues involved in ribosome function and protein processing. Subcellularly, the protein is localized to the Golgi apparatus and cytosol. In blood, RYK expression is associated with neutrophils, although its function in this context is unknown.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [TRIM24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8805), and [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorders and diseases of mental health.


The genome-wide association study identified a significant association between the RYK gene and [bone mineral density mean](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37500982). This trait was mapped to the closest existing MeSH term, [Minerals](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008903), using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in the ovary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, according to the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles, the gene is expressed in various tissues including the thyroid, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, small intestine, uterus, testis interstitial cells, and testis germ cells.


The input data highlights various pathways and processes related to WNT signaling, including the PCP/CE pathway, beta-catenin independent WNT signaling, and TCF dependent signaling in response to WNT. Additionally, it mentions the impact of RNF mutants on WNT signaling and proliferation, the role of XAV939 in inhibiting tankyrase and stabilizing AXIN, and the enhanced beta-catenin-dependent signaling in misspliced LRP5 mutants. The data also covers broader categories such as signaling by WNT in cancer, general WNT signaling, disease, and signal transduction.


The mouse ortholog gene 20187 and its human ortholog 6259 are associated with various abnormal phenotypes, including craniofacial, kidney, placenta, and skin morphologies, as well as cleft palate, edema, embryonic growth retardation, enlarged kidney, persistence of hyaloid vascular system, and complete preweaning lethality. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.
