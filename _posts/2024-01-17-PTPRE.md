The gene enables [protein tyrosine phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004725) and [transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005001), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). Additionally, it plays a role in [protein dephosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006470) and the [negative regulation of insulin receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046627).


The gene length is 15,612 base pairs (35.99% of all genes), the mature length is 1,235 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 15,583 base pairs.


The gene PTPRE (NCBI ID: 5791) has been mentioned in [6 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PTPRE%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1995, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2018 and 2020.

[PTPRE](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000132334-PTPRE) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase and protein phosphatase molecular functions. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in lymphoid tissue and bone marrow, where it is involved in the innate immune response. The protein is localized to intermediate filaments and is part of the non-specific membrane trafficking cluster in blood expression. In the brain, it is expressed in neurons with mixed functions. Additionally, PTPRE is expressed in monocytes, contributing to the innate immune response, and is associated with cell proliferation in various cell lines.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 6 experiments, [HNF4A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3172) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) each with 5 experiments, and [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) each with 4 experiments.
