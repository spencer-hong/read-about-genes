The gene enables [carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004095) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739) and the [mitochondrial outer membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005741). The gene is involved in several processes, including the [fatty acid metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006631), [fatty acid beta-oxidation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006635), the [carnitine shuttle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006853), the [carnitine metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009437), the [response to blue light](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009637), and [long-chain fatty acid transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015909).


The gene length is 179,744 base pairs (91.28% of all genes), the mature length is 1,783 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 93,911 base pairs.


The gene CPT1B (NCBI ID: 1375) has been mentioned in [65 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CPT1B%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1980 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2002 and 2015. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning CPT1B, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The Attenuation of Diabetic Nephropathy by Annexin A1 via Regulation of Lipid Metabolism Through the AMPK/PPARÎ±/CPT1b Pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34103347)" (2021) with a relative citation ratio of 4.57, "[A novel brain-expressed protein related to carnitine palmitoyltransferase I.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12376098)" (2002) with a relative citation ratio of 3.95, "[Increased reactive oxygen species production and lower abundance of complex I subunits and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B protein despite normal mitochondrial respiration in insulin-resistant human skeletal muscle.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20682693)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 3.71, and "[Multi-omics Integration Analysis Robustly Predicts High-Grade Patient Survival and Identifies CPT1B Effect on Fatty Acid Metabolism in Bladder Cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30846479)" (2019) with a relative citation ratio of 3.47. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CPT1B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000205560-CPT1B) is a gene encoding a protein with acyltransferase and transferase molecular functions, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene's RNA expression is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in heart muscle, where it is involved in cardiac muscle contraction. In blood, the gene is part of a non-specific cluster associated with ATP binding. Additionally, CPT1B is expressed in late spermatids, although its function in this context is unknown. The gene's expression in various cancer types is generally unprognostic, indicating no significant correlation with patient outcomes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 4 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 3 experiments, [RORC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6097) with 3 experiments, [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 3 experiments, and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, kidney disease, and urinary system disease.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart and spleen.


The proteins are involved in various metabolic processes, including fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism, as well as the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. Additionally, they participate in signaling pathways such as those mediated by retinoic acid and general signal transduction. Notably, they also play a role in the import of palmitoyl-CoA into the mitochondrial matrix.
