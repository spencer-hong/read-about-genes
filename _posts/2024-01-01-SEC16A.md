The gene length is 1,337,937 base pairs (99.86% of all genes), the mature length is 4,303 base pairs (86.23% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 1,288,562 base pairs (99.97% of all genes).


SEC16A has been studied in 7 publications, with the earliest publication in 2010 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2015 and 2017. For more information, see the [7 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SEC16A%22) on PubMed (note that the count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)).


The top five publications mentioning SEC16A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 regulates Sec16A at ER exit sites to allow ER-Golgi export.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25201882)" (2014) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 1.68, "[SEC16A is a RAB10 effector required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27354378)" (2016) with an RCR of 1.59, "[Sec16A is critical for both conventional and unconventional secretion of CFTR.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28067262)" (2017) with an RCR of 0.98, "[Private rare deletions in SEC16A and MAMDC4 may represent novel pathogenic variants in familial axial spondyloarthritis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25956157)" (2016) with an RCR of 0.53, and "[Sec16A defines the site for vesicle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum on exit from mitosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21045114)" (2010) with an RCR of 0.34. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 6 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 5 experiments, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 5 experiments, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 5 experiments, and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 4 experiments. These TFs play crucial roles in gene regulation and have been extensively studied in various biological contexts.





The SEC16A gene has been associated with various traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36224396) and [Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083408), which maps to the MeSH term [Lipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008074) using the BioWordVec method.


The mouse ortholog gene 227648 and its human ortholog gene 9919 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.6065 (24.73rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -59.55 (1.68th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.010 (81.5th percentile). The protein has a high instability index of 63.28 (88.23rd percentile) and an isoelectric point of 5.51 (18.43rd percentile). The sequence length is 2357 amino acids (98.42nd percentile) with a molecular weight of 251890.61 Da (98.27th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 28.13% for helix (17.76th percentile), 25.46% for sheet (9.87th percentile), and 40.05% for turn (97.39th percentile).
