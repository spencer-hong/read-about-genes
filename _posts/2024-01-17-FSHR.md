The gene FSHR (NCBI ID: 2492) has been mentioned in [499 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FSHR%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1974 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2002 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning FSHR, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mutation in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor gene causes hereditary hypergonadotropic ovarian failure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7553856)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 16.26), "[The follicle-stimulating hormone receptor: biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, and pathophysiology.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9408742)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 15.67), "[Men homozygous for an inactivating mutation of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor gene present variable suppression of spermatogenesis and fertility.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9020851)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 9.29), "[Establishment and characterization of a steroidogenic human granulosa-like tumor cell line, KGN, that expresses functional follicle-stimulating hormone receptor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11145608)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 8.72), and "[Androgens regulate ovarian follicular development by increasing follicle stimulating hormone receptor and microRNA-125b expression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24516121)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 8.53). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[FSHR](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000170820-FSHR) is a G-protein coupled receptor with functions as a receptor and transducer. It is involved in diseases and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in some tissues and is particularly expressed in spermatids, contributing to flagellum assembly. In the brain, it is found in non-specific clusters with mixed functions. Additionally, FSHR is expressed in kidney cancer cell lines, specifically in membrane components, and in neurons, where it plays a role in neuronal signaling.

The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including male reproductive organ cancer, reproductive organ cancer, prostate cancer, and broader categories such as cancer and disease of cellular proliferation. Additionally, the data highlights links to cognitive disorders, including bipolar disorder and mood disorders. Furthermore, associations with sexual dysfunction, sexual disorder, and polycystic ovary syndrome are also noted.


The genome-wide association study has identified a significant association between the FSHR gene and [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36224396).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary and fallopian tube, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the prefrontal cortex, cardiac myocytes, heart, liver, prostate, and specific lymphoma cell lines such as Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji and Daudi).


The input data includes various pathways involving hormone ligand-binding receptors, G alpha (s) signaling events, and Class A/1 (Rhodopsin-like receptors). It also highlights defective ACTH causing obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (POMCD), GPCR ligand binding, and metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes. Additionally, the data covers GPCR downstream signaling, signaling by GPCR, and general signal transduction processes.


The mouse ortholog gene 14309 and its human ortholog gene 2492 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities observed in both sexes. These include an abnormal startle reflex, decreased bone mineral content, decreased lean body mass, and increased total body fat amount.
