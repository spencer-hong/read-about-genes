[C1QL1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000131094-C1QL1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues, and the protein is localized in vesicles and the cytosol. The gene is expressed in oligodendrocytes involved in myelination (Cluster 9) and astrocytes with mixed functions (Cluster 19). In cell lines, it is expressed in kidney cancer membrane components (Cluster 15), and in single cells, it is found in horizontal and bipolar cells involved in neuronal signaling (Cluster 71). The gene is unprognostic for various cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Glioblastoma Multiforme.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), [SMAD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4088), and [NRF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4899) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including nerve, brain, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, spinal cord, temporal lobe, superior cervical ganglion, skeletal muscle, and atrioventricular node.
