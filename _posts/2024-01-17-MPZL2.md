The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is located in the [cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005856). It is active in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and is involved in [homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007156), [anatomical structure morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009653), and [cell-cell adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0098609).


The gene length is 368,942 base pairs (96.95% of all genes), the mature length is 5,194.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 267,948 base pairs.


The gene MPZL2 (NCBI ID: 10205) has been mentioned in [139 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MPZL2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1950 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1992 and 2015. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning MPZL2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Primary headache disorders in adolescents in North- and South-Tyrol: Findings of the EVA-Tyrol-Study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35331020)" (2022) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 3.54, "[EVA: Evaluation of protein structure prediction servers.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12824315)" (2003) with an RCR of 2.66, "[Radiation-Based Crosslinking Technique for Enhanced Thermal and Mechanical Properties of HDPE/EVA/PU Blends.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34451369)" (2021) with an RCR of 1.99, "[EVA: a new theoretically based molecular descriptor for use in QSAR/QSPR analysis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9089432)" (1997) with an RCR of 1.84, and "[EVA: large-scale analysis of secondary structure prediction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11835497)" (2001) with an RCR of 1.56. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MPZL2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000149573-MPZL2) is implicated in deafness and non-syndromic deafness, with evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized to cell junctions. Its expression is notable in monocytes and neutrophils involved in degranulation, squamous epithelium related to innate immune response, choroid plexus with mitochondrial function, and squamous epithelial cells undergoing keratinization.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, followed by [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), each with 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of mental health diseases.


The gene MPZL2 has been associated with [age-related hearing impairment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108613), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Hearing](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006309) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the esophagus, vagina, and salivary gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in colorectal adenocarcinoma, prostate, trachea, appendix, trigeminal ganglion, skin, and tongue.



The mouse ortholog gene 14012 is associated with the phenotype 'long tibia', and its human ortholog is gene 10205. This phenotype is not observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.035 (82.24th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -1.06 (46.48th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.993 (15.29th percentile), with a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 29.3% (25.8th percentile), 42.3% (91.33rd percentile), and 24.7% (19.1st percentile), respectively. The instability index is 38.6 (18.33rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.53 (43.2nd percentile). The protein has a length of 215 amino acids (16.75th percentile) and a molecular weight of 24483.9 Da (17.31st percentile).
