The gene is involved in [antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001788) and [immune system process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002376). It enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [IgG receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019770), and [IgG binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019864). The gene is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and the [secretory granule membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030667), and is active on the [external side of the plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009897). Additionally, it is involved in the [cell surface receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007166), [positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor production](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032760), and [positive regulation of phagocytosis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050766).


The gene length is 89,066 base pairs (79.61% of all genes), the mature length is 1,783 base pairs (46.61% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 82,174 base pairs (85.27% of all genes).


The gene FCGR2A (NCBI ID: 2212) has been mentioned in [415 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FCGR2A%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1988 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2004 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning FCGR2A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Fc gamma RIIA alleles are heritable risk factors for lupus nephritis in African Americans.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8636449)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 8.91), "[CD32a is a marker of a CD4 T-cell HIV reservoir harbouring replication-competent proviruses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28297712)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 6.9), "[Genome-wide association study identifies FCGR2A as a susceptibility locus for Kawasaki disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22081228)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 6.61), "[Molecular basis for a polymorphism of human Fc gamma receptor II (CD32).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2141627)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 6.57), and "[Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies engage and activate human neutrophils via Fc gamma RIIa.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8027554)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 6.18). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[FCGR2A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000143226-FCGR2A) is an IgG-binding protein and receptor with evidence at the protein level. It is an FDA-approved drug target and is detected in all tissues. The protein is localized in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. FCGR2A is highly expressed in neutrophils and is associated with lung function, immune response in macrophages and microglia, hemostasis in leukemia, and innate immune response in macrophages.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1051), [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [TCF12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6938) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) were found to be regulating in 3 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including immune system diseases such as systemic scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hypersensitivity reaction type II disease. Additionally, there are links to connective tissue diseases like collagen disease and rheumatic disease, as well as gastrointestinal system diseases such as ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and bacterial gastritis. Furthermore, the data highlights associations with infectious diseases, specifically bacterial infectious diseases, and lymphatic system diseases like lymphadenitis. Notably, Kawasaki disease is also implicated in the findings.


Genome-wide association studies have identified several traits and diseases associated with FCGR2A. Notably, various B-cell subtypes, including BAFF-R on B cell, IgD+ B cell, IgD+ CD24- B cell, IgD+ CD38dim B cell, and naive-mature B cell, have been mapped to [B-Lymphocytes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001402) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, traits such as basophil count and basophil percentage of white cells have been linked to [Basophils](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001491). Other immune cell markers, including CCR2 on monocyte, CD11b on CD14+ monocyte, and CD11b on CD33+ HLA DR+ CD14dim, have been associated with [Monocytes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D009000) and [HLA-DR Antigens](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006684), respectively. Furthermore, diseases such as [Crohn's disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26192919), [Inflammatory bowel disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23128233), [Kawasaki disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22081228), [Systemic lupus erythematosus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24871463), and [Ulcerative colitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19915573) have been directly mapped to their respective MeSH terms. These findings highlight the diverse roles of FCGR2A in immune cell function and disease pathogenesis.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including lung, blood, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD33+ Myeloid cells, CD14+ Monocytes, Whole Blood, Leukemia (chronic Myelogenous K-562), Lung, Placenta, and Olfactory Bulb.


The input data highlights several pathways related to the immune system, including the innate immune system, FCGR activation, the role of phospholipids in phagocytosis, Fcgamma receptor (FCGR) dependent phagocytosis, and the regulation of actin dynamics for phagocytic cup formation.


The mouse ortholog gene 14131 and its human ortholog gene 2212 are associated with phenotypes including decreased circulating creatine kinase level, observed in one sex, and tremors, observed in both sexes.
