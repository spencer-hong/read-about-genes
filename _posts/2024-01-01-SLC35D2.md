The gene length is 705,766 base pairs (99.15% of all genes), the mature length is 5,770 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 705,736 base pairs (99.66% of all genes).


The gene SLC35D2, with NCBI ID 11046, has been the subject of [2 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLC35D2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1969, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1978 and 1996.


The top publications mentioning SLC35D2 include "[Repressor-minus and operator-constitutive de-repressed mutants of F-like R factors: their effect on chromosomal transfer by HfrC.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4904464)" (1969) (relative citation ratio: 1.7) and "[Identification and characterization of human Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter SLC35D2, a novel member of the SLC35 nucleotide sugar transporter family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15607426)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.89). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each with 5. Additionally experiments, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) were found in 4 experiments each, while [KLF5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/688) was identified in 3 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.713 (97.77th percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity. The protein's charge at pH 7 is 5.62 (69.96th percentile), and its median structural flexibility is 0.982 (5.44th percentile).
