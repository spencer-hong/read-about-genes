The gene length is 3,275 base pairs (9.1% of all genes), the mature length is 1,580.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 1,878.5 base pairs.


The gene POLG (NCBI ID: 5428) has been mentioned in [316 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLG%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1987. The middle 50% of these publications were published between 2009 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning POLG, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that highlight the gene's association with various disorders. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable publications include "[Mutation of POLG is associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia characterized by mtDNA deletions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11431686)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 12.09), "[POLG-related disorders and their neurological manifestations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30451971)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 10.59), "[POLG mutations associated with Alpers' syndrome and mitochondrial DNA depletion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15122711)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 6.63), "[Molecular and clinical genetics of mitochondrial diseases due to POLG mutations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18546365)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 4.85), and "[Estrogen receptor Î± controls metabolism in white and brown adipocytes by regulating <i>Polg1</i> and mitochondrial remodeling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32759275)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 4.6).

[POLG](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000140521-POLG) is a gene with diverse molecular functions, including DNA-binding, DNA-directed DNA polymerase, hydrolase, lyase, nucleotidyltransferase, and transferase activities. It is implicated in several diseases such as epilepsy, Leigh syndrome, neurodegeneration, neuropathy, primary mitochondrial disease, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. POLG is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the mitochondria. Its expression is associated with various clusters, including Cluster 12 for non-specific mitochondrial translation in blood, Cluster 66 for non-specific transcription in tissues, Cluster 32 in the cerebral cortex for mixed function in the brain, Cluster 59 in leukemia for T-cell receptor in cell lines, and Cluster 28 in dendritic cells for antigen presentation in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980) and [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [REST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5978), and [AFF4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/27125) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as breast cancer, thoracic cancer, and lung disease. Metabolic disorders are also prominent, with links to diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and vascular disease, are also implicated. Neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and dementia are noted, along with mental health disorders like bipolar disorder. Additionally, the data highlights bone diseases, specifically osteoporosis.


The gene POLG has been associated with [venlafaxine response in generalised anxiety disorder (responders vs non-responders after 24 weeks)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28437668), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Depression](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D003863) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including nerve, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Superior Cervical Ganglion, Skeletal Muscle, Atrioventricular Node, Ciliary Ganglion, and Tongue.
