[MGAT4A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000071073-MGAT4A) is a gene encoding a protein with glycosyltransferase and transferase molecular functions. Evidence supports its expression at the protein level, and it is detected in all RNA tissue distributions. The protein is localized in the Golgi apparatus. MGAT4A is expressed in various clusters, including T-cells with unknown function in blood, bone marrow associated with cell proliferation in tissues, non-specific transcription in the brain, ciliated cells with ion channel activity in cell lines, and NK-cells and T-cells related to the immune system and transcription in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 6 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 5 experiments, [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 5 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 5 experiments, and [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of mental health diseases.



The gene is expressed in the pancreas and small intestine according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, liver, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, superior cervical ganglion, and skeletal muscle.


The input data highlights various diseases and processes related to glycosylation, particularly asparagine N-linked glycosylation. Notably, defects in specific proteins such as ALG2, ALG3, ALG6, ALG8, ALG9, DPAGT1, MAN1B1, MGAT2, MOGS, MPDU1, ALG1, ALG12, ALG11, ALG14, and RFT1 are linked to distinct congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) and other conditions like congenital myasthenic syndrome. Additionally, the data covers broader categories including diseases associated with N-glycosylation of proteins, post-translational protein modification, metabolism of proteins, and various stages of N-glycan antennae elongation and transport to the Golgi.
