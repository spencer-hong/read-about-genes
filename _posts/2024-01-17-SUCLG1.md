The gene length is 2,106 base pairs (5.58% of all genes), the mature length is 1,093 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 2,106 base pairs.


The gene SUCLG1 (NCBI ID: 8802) has been mentioned in [187 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SUCLG1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1996 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2004 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning SUCLG1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Src tyrosine kinases, Galpha subunits, and H-Ras share a common membrane-anchored scaffolding protein, caveolin. Caveolin binding negatively regulates the auto-activation of Src tyrosine kinases.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8910575)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 14.34), "[Universal allosteric mechanism for Gα activation by GPCRs.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26147082)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 7.8), "[Fibrous Dysplasia/McCune-Albright Syndrome: A Rare, Mosaic Disease of Gα\u200as Activation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31673695)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 5.51), "[The maize Gα gene COMPACT PLANT2 functions in CLAVATA signalling to control shoot meristem size.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24025774)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 5.35), and "[Dehydroepiandrosterone activates endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase by a specific plasma membrane receptor coupled to Galpha(i2,3).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11934890)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 5.29). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SUCLG1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000163541-SUCLG1) is a gene encoding a protein with ligase molecular function. It is involved in primary mitochondrial disease, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. The gene is expressed in all tissues and is localized to the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and cytosol. Its expression is notably high in kidney and intestine tissues, where it plays a role in metabolism. In the brain, it is involved in non-specific metabolic processes. At the single-cell level, SUCLG1 is particularly active in proximal tubular cells, contributing to amino acid metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942), and [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and cardiovascular system disease. Additionally, broader categories such as disease and disease of anatomical entity are also implicated.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, colon, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, colon, small intestine, kidney, skeletal muscle, and tongue.


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in cellular metabolism, including the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle), pyruvate metabolism, and respiratory electron transport. These pathways are integral to energy production and the regulation of metabolic processes within the cell.


The mouse ortholog gene 56451 and its human ortholog 8802 are associated with phenotypes including embryonic lethality prior to the tooth bud stage, which is not observed in both sexes, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which is observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.0225 (82.89th percentile), indicating a slightly hydrophilic nature.
