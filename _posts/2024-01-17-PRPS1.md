[PRPS1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000147224-PRPS1) is a gene encoding a protein with kinase and transferase molecular functions. It is implicated in various diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, deafness, gout, intellectual disability, neurodegeneration, neuropathy, non-syndromic deafness, and retinitis pigmentosa. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in vesicles. Its expression is associated with various clusters, including Cluster 3 for blood expression related to nuclear processes, Cluster 60 for tissue expression related to transmembrane transport in the choroid plexus, Cluster 44 for brain expression with mixed function, Cluster 36 for cell line expression related to mRNA processing, and Cluster 78 for single cell expression in NK-cells and T-cells involved in the immune system and transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 5 experiments, [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 4 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 4 experiments, [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908) with 4 experiments, and [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including the thyroid and pituitary gland. Additionally, it is expressed in several immune cell types such as B lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, CD56+ natural killer cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells. Expression is also observed in CD105+ endothelial cells and CD71+ early erythroid cells.


The input data highlights several pathways involving carbohydrate metabolism, including general metabolism and specific processes like 5-phosphoribose 1-diphosphate biosynthesis. Additionally, it covers diseases related to glycogen storage and myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora.


The mouse ortholog gene 19139 and its human ortholog gene 5631 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.
