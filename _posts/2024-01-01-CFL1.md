The gene length is 468,055 base pairs (98.11% of all genes), the mature length is 4,044 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 442,280 base pairs.


The gene CFL1 (NCBI ID: 1072) has been the subject of [624 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CFL1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication dating back to 1985. The middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning CFL1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Regulation of actin dynamics through phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM-kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9655397)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 21.03), "[Cofilin phosphorylation by LIM-kinase 1 and its role in Rac-mediated actin reorganization.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9655398)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 19.19), "[Actin depolymerizing factor (ADF/cofilin) enhances the rate of filament turnover: implication in actin-based motility.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9087445)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 15.23), "[Cofilin changes the twist of F-actin: implications for actin filament dynamics and cellular function.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9265645)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 11.09), and "[Cofilin promotes actin polymerization and defines the direction of cell motility.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15118165)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 9.68). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065) and [TRIM24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8805) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.


Based on the data from GTRD's database of transcription factor (TF) binding sites and filtered for Perturb-seq data, the top transcription factors in terms of the number of experiments showing their regulatory role are [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) with 3 experiments, [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7023) with 2 experiments, and [TBPL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6830) with 1 experiment.








The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.359 (51.11th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 1.57 at pH 7.0 (55.81st percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.01 (81.7th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be predominantly helical (42.77%, 96.77th percentile), with significant sheet (33.73%, 50.11th percentile) and turn (25.30%, 23.69th percentile) components. The instability index is 41.16 (25.83rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.22 (61.45th percentile). The protein has a length of 166 amino acids (10.05th percentile) and a molecular weight of 18502.28 Da (10th percentile).
