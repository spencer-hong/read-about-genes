The gene [RPL10](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110225-RPL10) functions as a ribonucleoprotein and ribosomal protein, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol. The gene is part of Cluster 43 in blood expression, Cluster 18 in tissue expression, Cluster 41 in brain expression, Cluster 25 in cell line expression, and Cluster 64 in single cell expression, all of which are associated with non-specific ribosomal functions and neurotransmitter signaling.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 5 experiments, [ME3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10873) with 4 experiments, [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 4 experiments, [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019) with 4 experiments, and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) and [NFE2L2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623), each shown to regulate genes in three experiments. Additionally, [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872) and [KLF6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861) were found to regulate genes in two experiments each. [CEBPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6830) and [RORA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) were each shown to regulate genes in one experiment.








The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.512 (33.76th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 38.72 at pH 7.0 (98.53rd percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.010 (80.99th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be predominantly helical (46.05%, 98.77th percentile), with lower proportions of sheet (24.19%, 6.86th percentile) and turn (18.14%, 0.96th percentile) structures. The instability index is 34.77 (9.72nd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 10.94 (98.97th percentile). The protein has a length of 215 amino acids (16.75th percentile) and a molecular weight of 23431.57 Da (15.93rd percentile).
