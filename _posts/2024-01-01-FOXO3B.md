The gene length is 737.0 base pairs (0.94% of all genes), with a mature length of 737.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 737.0 base pairs.


The gene FOXO3B, with NCBI Gene ID 2310, has been featured in [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FOXO3B%22) (count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2013, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2015 and 2016.


The top publications mentioning FOXO3B, ranked by their scientific influence as measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), include "[Zebrafish foxo3b Negatively Regulates Antiviral Response through Suppressing the Transactivity of irf3 and irf7.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27815423)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 1.36), "[Genetic investigation of FOXO3A requires special attention due to sequence homology with FOXO3B.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22588664)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 0.46), "[Foxo3b but not Foxo3a activates cyp19a1a in Epinephelus coioides.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26960338)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 0.35), and "[A splice junction-targeted CRISPR approach (spJCRISPR) reveals human FOXO3B to be a protein-coding gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29925039)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.34). The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [None](https://www.proteinatlas.org/None-None) is involved in DNA-binding and has evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is associated with Cluster 6 in the brain, which is involved in immune response. In cell lines, it is part of Cluster 42 with an unknown function, and in single cells, it is found in Schwann cells and Melanocytes with mixed function. The gene is unprognostic for various cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, Colon Adenocarcinoma, Glioblastoma Multiforme, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma, Rectum Adenocarcinoma, Skin Cutaneous Melanoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma, and Testicular Germ Cell Tumor.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) and [NR2F2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7026), each with 2 experiments. Additionally, [SSRP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6749), [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313), and [WT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7490) were each found to be regulating in 1 experiment.
