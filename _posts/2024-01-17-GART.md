The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [brainstem development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003360), [cerebellum development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0021549), and [cerebral cortex development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0021987). It plays a role in several biosynthetic processes such as [purine nucleotide biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006164), [GMP biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006177), ['de novo' IMP biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006189), ['de novo' AMP biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0044208), [adenine biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046084), and ['de novo' XMP biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097294). Additionally, it is involved in [glycine metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006544) and [tetrahydrofolate biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046654). The gene enables several molecular functions, including [phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004637), [phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine cyclo-ligase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004641), [phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004644), [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524), and [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872). It is active in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and is located in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). Furthermore, the gene is involved in responses to both [organic substance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010033) and [inorganic substance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010035).


The gene length is 633,429 base pairs (98.97% of all genes), the mature length is 5,835.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 329,642.5 base pairs (98.21% of all genes).


The gene GART (NCBI ID: 2618) has been mentioned in [43 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GART%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1912 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1991 and 2013. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning GART, ranked by their relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows:

[GART](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000159131-GART) is a multifunctional enzyme with ligase and transferase activities, and it is an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence supports its expression at the protein level, and it is detected in all tissues. GART is localized in the mitochondria and cytosol. Its expression is associated with cell proliferation in blood, basic cellular processes in testis, mixed functions in oligodendrocytes in the brain, hemostasis in leukemia cell lines, and basic cellular processes in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757), [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), and [MBL2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4153), each shown to be regulating in 6 experiments.

The gene is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, breast, and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Lymphoma burkitts (Raji), 721 B lymphoblasts, Leukemia chronic myelogenous K-562, Leukemia promyelocytic HL-60, Lymphoma burkitts (Daudi), Superior cervical ganglion, and Skeletal muscle.


The input data highlights pathways involved in metabolism, specifically focusing on the metabolism of nucleotides. Within this broader category, the data emphasizes purine metabolism, particularly the biosynthesis of purine ribonucleoside monophosphate.


The mouse ortholog gene 14450 and its human ortholog gene 2618 are associated with several phenotypes, including embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, embryonic lethality prior to tooth bud stage, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. Notably, the preweaning lethality phenotype is observed in both sexes.
