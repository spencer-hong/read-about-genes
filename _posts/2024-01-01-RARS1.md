The gene length is 511,043 base pairs (98.44% of all genes), the mature length is 6,362 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 505,432 base pairs (99.27% of all genes).


The gene RARS1 (NCBI ID: 5917) has been the subject of [32 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RARS1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink). The earliest year of publication is 1977, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2000 and 2014.


The top five publications mentioning RARS1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Mutations in RARS cause hypomyelination.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24777941)" (2014) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 2.53, "[The <i>RARS-MAD1L1</i> Fusion Gene Induces Cancer Stem Cell-like Properties and Therapeutic Resistance in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29133573)" (2018) with an RCR of 1.95, "[Existence of two forms of rat liver arginyl-tRNA synthetase suggests channeling of aminoacyl-tRNA for protein synthesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2187187)" (1990) with an RCR of 1.33, "[Improved survival with iron chelation therapy for red blood cell transfusion dependent lower IPSS risk MDS may be more significant in patients with a non-RARS diagnosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22921191)" (2012) with an RCR of 1.19, and "[The JAK2 V617F mutation is rare in RARS but common in RARS-T.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16932338)" (2006) with an RCR of 1.12. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [SNAI2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6591), [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886), [ZFX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7543), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.





The genome-wide association study has identified a link between the RARS1 gene and [Body mass index (MTAG)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36376304), with the closest MeSH match being [Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020481). This association was determined using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method for embedding match.





The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.2801515151515148 (60.11th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -4.478484647259336 (35.02nd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.0006666666666668 (44.91st percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix (0.3575757575757576, 79.37th percentile) and sheet (0.36818181818181817, 71.85th percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (0.24393939393939393, 17.55th percentile). The instability index is 43.50171212121225 (33.9th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.257427406311035 (36.95th percentile). The protein has a length of 660 amino acids (72.79th percentile) and a molecular weight of 75378.12050000046 Da (73.77th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
