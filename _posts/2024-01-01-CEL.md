The gene length is 932,611 base pairs (99.57% of all genes), the mature length is 2,982 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 556,651 base pairs (99.41% of all genes).


The gene CEL (NCBI ID: 1056) has been featured in [308 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CEL%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1948, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1985 and 2006.


The top five publications mentioning the CEL gene, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Purification and characterization of a carboxyl ester hydrolase from human pancreatic juice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/718955)" (1978) (relative citation ratio: 5.25), "[A recombined allele of the lipase gene CEL and its pseudogene CELP confers susceptibility to chronic pancreatitis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25774637)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 5.22), "[Studies on the substrate specificity of a carboxyl ester hydrolase from human pancreatic juice. II. Action on cholesterol esters and lipid-soluble vitamin esters.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7350913)" (1980) (relative citation ratio: 5.13), "[Nonoxidative ethanol metabolism: formation of fatty acid ethyl esters by cholesterol esterase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6955782)" (1982) (relative citation ratio: 4.38), and "[Chemoprevention with low-dose aspirin, mesalazine, or both in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis without previous colectomy (J-FAPP Study IV): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, two-by-two factorial design trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33812492)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 4.29). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [Hydrolase, Serine esterase](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) is involved in diabetes mellitus and has evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in the pancreas, where it is associated with proteolysis (Cluster 15). In the brain, it is found in the choroid plexus with mixed functions (Cluster 23). Additionally, it is expressed in ciliated cells with ion channel activity (Cluster 10) and in pancreatic exocrine cells involved in proteolysis (Cluster 60).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each with 2 experiments. Additionally, [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), and [GLIS3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/169792) were each found in 1 experiment.
