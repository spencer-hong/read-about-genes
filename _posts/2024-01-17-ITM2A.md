The gene enables [amyloid-beta binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001540) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is involved in [plasma cell differentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002317) and the [negative regulation of amyloid precursor protein biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042985). The gene is active in the [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794) and the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886).


The gene length is 18,994 base pairs (40.84% of all genes), the mature length is 956.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 16,048.5 base pairs.


The gene ITM2A (NCBI ID: 9452) has been mentioned in [14 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ITM2A%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2008 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2016 and 2020.

[ITM2A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000078596-ITM2A) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, vesicles, and plasma membrane. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood expression related to non-specific cell proliferation, Cluster 71 for tissue expression associated with the adaptive immune response in the thymus, Cluster 47 for brain expression in endothelial cells related to vasculature, Cluster 59 for cell line expression in leukemia related to the T-cell receptor, and Cluster 53 for single cell expression in fibroblasts involved in ECM organization.
