The gene SLC6A3 (NCBI ID: 6531) has been mentioned in [1,738 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLC6A3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1960, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2016.


The top five publications mentioning SLC6A3, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Association of attention-deficit disorder and the dopamine transporter gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7717410)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 21.55), "[Association of dopamine transporter reduction with psychomotor impairment in methamphetamine abusers.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11229977)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 17.86), "[Dopamine transporter occupancies in the human brain induced by therapeutic doses of oral methylphenidate.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9766762)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 17.8), "[X-ray structure of dopamine transporter elucidates antidepressant mechanism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24037379)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 15.35), and "[Dopamine transporter brain imaging to assess the effects of pramipexole vs levodopa on Parkinson disease progression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11926889)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 14.56). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[SLC6A3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142319-SLC6A3) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, implicated in various diseases including dystonia, neurodegeneration, and Parkinsonism. It is also a target for FDA-approved drugs. The gene is detected in single RNA tissue distribution and is localized in vesicles. Its expression is notable in oligodendrocytes involved in myelination, and it plays a role in monoamine neurotransmitter signaling in the brain. Additionally, SLC6A3 is expressed in kidney cancer membrane components and lymphatic endothelial cells involved in lymph vessel development.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) were each found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked specific genetic variants to a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as male reproductive organ cancer, testicular cancer, head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, intestinal cancer, large intestine cancer, gastrointestinal system cancer, and lung cancer. Additionally, associations have been found with respiratory system diseases, including lower respiratory tract disease and lung disease, as well as cardiovascular system diseases such as artery disease and vascular disease. Other conditions identified include hypertension, kidney disease, urinary system disease, and physical disorders like orofacial cleft. These findings highlight the broad impact of genetic factors on diverse disease conditions.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, thyroid, and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), hypothalamus, adipocytes, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscle, ciliary ganglion, and dorsal root ganglion.


The input data highlights several pathways involving the transport and clearance of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine, within the synaptic cleft. These pathways include dopamine clearance from the synaptic cleft, neurotransmitter clearance in the synaptic cleft, and the involvement of amine compound SLC transporters. Additionally, the data mentions Na+/Cl- dependent neurotransmitter transporters, SLC-mediated transmembrane transport, and the broader category of transmembrane transport of small molecules. The pathways also encompass the transport of various substances such as glucose, sugars, bile salts, organic acids, metal ions, and amine compounds. Furthermore, the data indicates the involvement of the neuronal system and transmission across chemical synapses.


The mouse ortholog gene 13162 and its human ortholog 6531 are associated with several phenotypes, including absent teeth, decreased circulating free fatty acids level, hyperactivity, and increased circulating sodium level. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.499 (95.13th percentile), indicating a high level of hydrophobicity. The protein exhibits a charge of -2.54 at pH 7.0 (41.01st percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.982 (5.75th percentile). The secondary structure affinities are notable, with 28.23% of amino acids tending to be in a helix (18.38th percentile), 46.45% in a sheet (95.8th percentile), and 27.26% in a turn (40.36th percentile). The instability index is 30.85 (4.76th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.46 (41.71st percentile).
