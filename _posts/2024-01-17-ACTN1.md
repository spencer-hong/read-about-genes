ACTN1 (Gene ID: 87) has been mentioned in [400 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ACTN1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1965 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1989 and 2008. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning ACTN1, ranked by their scientific influence, include [The structure and function of alpha-actinin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2671039) (1989) (relative citation ratio: 9.35), [Some properties of purified skeletal muscle alpha-actinin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/977599) (1976) (relative citation ratio: 7.65), [Requirement of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for alpha-actinin function.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1326084) (1992) (relative citation ratio: 7.27), [Altered distributions of the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and alpha-actinin in cultured fibroblasts transformed by Rous sarcoma virus.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6256755) (1980) (relative citation ratio: 6.51), and [Interaction of alpha-actinin and vinculin with actin: opposite effects on filament network formation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6789327) (1981) (relative citation ratio: 6.19). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[ACTN1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000072110-ACTN1) is an actin-binding protein with evidence at the protein level. It is involved in disease variants and is an FDA-approved drug target. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in various subcellular locations, including the plasma membrane, actin filaments, focal adhesion sites, primary cilium, primary cilium transition zone, and cytosol. ACTN1 is expressed in neutrophils with unknown function (Cluster 21) and is associated with smooth muscle tissue involved in ECM organization (Cluster 41). In the brain, it is found in the choroid plexus with mixed function (Cluster 23). Additionally, ACTN1 is expressed in non-specific cell lines involved in gene expression regulation (Cluster 30) and in smooth muscle cells involved in muscle contraction (Cluster 32).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 6 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 6 experiments, [RUNX1T1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/862) with 6 experiments, [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) with 5 experiments, and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and hypertension, neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and tauopathy, mental health disorders such as bipolar disorder and substance dependence, and gastrointestinal system diseases like periodontitis and mouth disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood vessel and bladder, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, whole blood, smooth muscle, bronchial epithelial cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, prostate, and uterus.


The proteins are involved in various pathways, including nephrin interactions, extracellular matrix organization, non-integrin membrane-ECM interactions, syndecan interactions, cell junction organization, cell-cell communication, cell-extracellular matrix interactions, regulation of cytoskeletal remodeling and cell spreading by IPP complex components, hemostasis, platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, platelet degranulation, and response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca2+.
