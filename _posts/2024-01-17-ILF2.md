[ILF2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000143621-ILF2) is a gene that functions as an activator with DNA-binding capabilities. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. The gene is part of various non-specific expression clusters related to cell proliferation, transcription, metabolism, nuclear processes, and basic cellular processes. Evidence for ILF2 is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) and [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cancer, particularly hematologic and immune system cancers such as multiple myeloma and bone marrow cancer. Additionally, there are associations with cardiovascular system diseases, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and myocardial infarction. The data also encompasses broader categories such as diseases of cellular proliferation, organ system cancer, and general diseases of anatomical entities.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including the pituitary gland, 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, Lymphoma_burkitts (Daudi), CD105+ endothelial cells, and Leukemialymphoblastic (MOLT-4) cells.
