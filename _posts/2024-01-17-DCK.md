The gene length is 75,758 base pairs (76.25th percentile), the mature length is 2,711 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 75,756 base pairs.


The gene DCK (NCBI ID: 1633) has been mentioned in [233 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DCK%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning DCK is 1968, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1996 and 2011.


The top 5 publications mentioning DCK, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Comparison of the substrate specificities of human thymidine kinase 1 and 2 and deoxycytidine kinase toward antiviral and cytostatic nucleoside analogs.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2025274)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 6.52), "[Metabolite elucidation of 2-fluoro-deschloroketamine (2F-DCK) using molecular networking across three complementary in vitro and in vivo models.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34515415)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 6.26), "[Mammalian deoxynucleoside kinase. I. Deoxycytidine kinase: purification, properties, and kinetic studies with cytosine arabinoside.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5684726)" (1968) (relative citation ratio: 5.79), "[Induction of both thymidine and deoxycytidine kinase activity by herpes viruses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4372299)" (1974) (relative citation ratio: 5.36), and "[Fatal intoxication related to two new arylcyclohexylamine derivatives (2F-DCK and 3-MeO-PCE).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34049075)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 5.11). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[DCK](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000156136-DCK) is a gene encoding a protein with kinase and transferase molecular functions. It is an FDA-approved drug target with evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. Its expression is associated with various clusters, including Cluster 12 for non-specific mitochondrial translation in blood, Cluster 71 for adaptive immune response in thymus tissue, Cluster 28 for mixed function in brain oligodendrocytes, Cluster 46 for humoral immune response in lymphoma cell lines, and Cluster 28 for antigen presentation in dendritic cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [TP63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8626), and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [NONO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4841) and [MECOM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2122) were found to be regulating in 4 experiments each.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Lymphoma burkitts (Raji), BDCA4+ Dentritic Cells, CD19+ BCells (neg. sel.), Leukemia promyelocytic-HL-60, Lymphoma burkitts (Daudi), CD105+ Endothelial, CD71+ Early Erythroid, and Thymus.


The input data highlights several pathways involved in metabolism, specifically focusing on nucleotide metabolism. This includes purine metabolism, with an emphasis on purine salvage, as well as pyrimidine metabolism, particularly pyrimidine salvage reactions.
