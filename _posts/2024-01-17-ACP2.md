The gene product enables [acid phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003993) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [lysosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005764), [lysosomal membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005765), [lysosomal lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043202), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). Additionally, it is involved in [lysosome organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007040) and [dephosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016311).


The gene length is 100,491.0 base pairs (81.86% of all genes), the mature length is 3,840.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 77,194.5 base pairs.


The gene ACP2 (NCBI ID: 53) has been mentioned in [46 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ACP2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1967 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1980 and 1992. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning ACP2, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that delve into the targeting and transport mechanisms of lysosomal acid phosphatase. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable works include "[Targeting of a lysosomal membrane protein: a tyrosine-containing endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail of lysosomal acid phosphatase is necessary and sufficient for targeting to lysosomes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2209556)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 3.57), "[Lysosomal acid phosphatase is transported to lysosomes via the cell surface.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2583113)" (1989) (relative citation ratio: 3.53), "[Human lysosomal acid phosphatase is transported as a transmembrane protein to lysosomes in transfected baby hamster kidney cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3056714)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 3.01), "[Human lysosomal acid phosphatase: cloning, expression and chromosomal assignment.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3191910)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 2.84), and "[The essential tyrosine of the internalization signal in lysosomal acid phosphatase is part of a beta turn.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1760845)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 2.84).

[ACP2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134575-ACP2) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in monocytes and neutrophils related to innate immune response (Cluster 37). The gene is also expressed in various tissue clusters, including those involved in protein processing (Cluster 68), and is particularly active in liver cancer cell lines (Cluster 7), macrophages (Cluster 58), and mixed function brain clusters (Cluster 44).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 6 experiments, [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019) with 5 experiments, [TFAP2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7020) with 4 experiments, [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725) with 4 experiments, and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent detection in multiple experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cardiovascular system disease, general disease, and diseases of anatomical entities.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the liver, adrenal gland, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the liver, whole brain, prostate, lung, placenta, and adrenal gland.



The mouse ortholog gene 11432 and its human ortholog gene 53 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities observed in both sexes. These include a decrease in the number of CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cells, a general decrease in T cell number, decreased bone mineral density, and increased bone mineral content.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.326, indicating a hydrophilic nature (54.94th percentile). It exhibits a charge of -3.55 at pH 7 (37.76th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.997 (27.93rd percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 31.21% helix (43.09th percentile), 37.83% sheet (77.57th percentile), and 26.00% turn (29.12th percentile).
