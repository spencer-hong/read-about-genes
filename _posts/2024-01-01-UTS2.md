The gene length is 730.0 base pairs (0.9% of all genes), the mature length is 730.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 730.0 base pairs.


The gene UTS2, with NCBI ID 10911, has been the subject of [370 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22UTS2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1972, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2004 and 2013.


The top five publications mentioning UTS2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human urotensin-II is a potent vasoconstrictor and agonist for the orphan receptor GPR14.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10499587)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 15.94), "[Co-expression of urotensin II and its receptor (GPR14) in human cardiovascular and renal tissues.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11725162)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 5.01), "[Identification of urotensin II as the endogenous ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor GPR14.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10581185)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 4.9), "[Human urotensin II-induced contraction and arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation are mediated by RhoA and Rho-kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11397774)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 4.6), and "[Congestive heart failure and expression of myocardial urotensin II.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12076554)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 4.51). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [Hormone](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) functions as a hormone and has evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues. The gene is expressed in T-regs involved in cell cycle regulation (Cluster 9) and is associated with oligodendrocytes involved in myelination (Cluster 9). In the brain, it is found in the hindbrain with mixed functions (Cluster 43). Additionally, it is expressed in bone cancer cell lines involved in neuronal signaling (Cluster 12) and in NK-cells involved in the adaptive immune response (Cluster 19). The gene is unprognostic for several cancer types, including Breast Invasive Carcinoma, Colon Adenocarcinoma, Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, Prostate Adenocarcinoma, Rectum Adenocarcinoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma, and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) with 3 experiments, [PBX3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5090) with 2 experiments, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 2 experiments, [HOXB13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10481) with 2 experiments, and [ONECUT2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9480) with 2 experiments.





The genome-wide association study has identified a significant association between the UTS2 gene and [Height](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29782485).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.2024 (68.87th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of 0.6553 (52.52nd percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.0033 (56.58th percentile), with a notable fraction of amino acids predicted to be in helix (37.10%, 85.58th percentile), sheet (36.29%, 68.28th percentile), and turn (29.03%, 56.18th percentile) conformations. The instability index is 49.82 (56.63rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 7.67 (55.98th percentile). The protein has a length of 124 amino acids (4.99th percentile) and a molecular weight of 14295.47 Da (5.64th percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, as detailed [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
