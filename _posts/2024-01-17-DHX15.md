[DHX15](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000109606-DHX15) is a gene with molecular functions including helicase, hydrolase, and RNA-binding. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized to nuclear speckles. The gene is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood expression related to cell proliferation, Cluster 71 for tissue expression related to adaptive immune response in the thymus, Cluster 50 for brain expression related to nucleic acid binding, Cluster 22 for cell line expression related to mRNA splicing and cell cycle, and Cluster 15 for single cell expression with mixed functions. Evidence for DHX15 is available at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), and [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), each with 5 experiments.

The gene is expressed in various tissues, including breast and nerve, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in multiple cell types such as 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+, CD4+_Tcells, CD8+_Tcells, Leukemia_promyelocytic-HL-60, Lymphoma_burkitts(Daudi), CD105+_Endothelial, and Leukemialymphoblastic(MOLT-4).



The mouse ortholog gene 13204 and its human ortholog gene 1665 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal lens morphology, cataract, decreased mean corpuscular volume, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance. Additionally, embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis is observed, although this phenotype is not present in both sexes.
