The gene enables [ATPase activator activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001671), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524), [Hsp70 protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030544), [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872), [unfolded protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051082), and [protein-folding chaperone binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051087). It is active in and located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), and is also located in the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020) and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). The gene is involved in the [positive regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008284), [response to heat](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009408), and [protein refolding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042026).


The gene length is 13,982 base pairs (33.41% of all genes), the mature length is 820 base pairs (14.7% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 11,022 base pairs (35.89% of all genes).


The gene DNAJA2, with NCBI ID 10294, has been mentioned in [16 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DNAJA2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1986, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1998 and 2004.


The top five publications mentioning DNAJA2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Structure, function and evolution of DnaJ: conservation and adaptation of chaperone function.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9585179)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 8.41), "[Autoimmunity is triggered by cPR-3(105-201), a protein complementary to human autoantigen proteinase-3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14661018)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 5.6), "[The nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli K12 dnaJ+ gene. A gene that encodes a heat shock protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3003085)" (1986) (relative citation ratio: 3.77), "[Human DnaJ homologs dj2 and dj3, and bag-1 are positive cochaperones of hsc70.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10816573)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 1.83), and "[Mutation of host DnaJ homolog inhibits brome mosaic virus negative-strand RNA synthesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12584324)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 1.26). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[DNAJA2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000069345-DNAJA2) is a gene that functions as a chaperone, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoli and cytosol. The gene is part of various non-specific expression clusters, including those related to transcription and translation in blood, cellular respiration in tissues, transcription in the brain, cell cycle regulation in cell lines, and mixed functions in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6772) with 5 experiments, followed by [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), [HIF1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3091), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each with 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, and general disease categories. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of various respiratory and broader disease conditions.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, adrenal gland, whole brain, bronchial epithelial cells, colon, and small intestine. Additionally, it is expressed in promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60).



The mouse ortholog gene 56445, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 10294, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal vitreous body morphology and no spontaneous movement, both observed in both sexes. Additionally, the gene is linked to female infertility, a phenotype specific to females, and preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance, which affects both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.698 (17.74th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -5.56 (32.16th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.014 (90.02nd percentile). The protein has a predicted secondary structure with 30.6% helix (37.05th percentile), 27.2% sheet (15.14th percentile), and 33.0% turn (82.01st percentile) affinities. The instability index is 39.21 (20.07th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.06 (32.11th percentile). The protein is 412 amino acids long (46.91st percentile) with a molecular weight of 45745.11 Da (46.59th percentile).
