The gene enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is involved in [fibroblast growth factor binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0017134). It is active in and located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), and is part of the [spliceosomal complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005681). Additionally, it is located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and [nuclear speck](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016607). The gene is involved in the [negative regulation of apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043066), [fibroblast apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0044346), and [negative regulation of fibroblast apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:2000270).


The gene length is 66,604 base pairs (73.51% of all genes), the mature length is 2,784.5 base pairs (69.22% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 15,651 base pairs (45.17% of all genes).


The gene API5 (NCBI ID: 8539) has been mentioned in [33 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22API5%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1985 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2009 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning API5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Profiling microRNA expression in hepatocellular carcinoma reveals microRNA-224 up-regulation and apoptosis inhibitor-5 as a microRNA-224-specific target.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18319255)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 6.96), "[Functional identification of Api5 as a suppressor of E2F-dependent apoptosis in vivo.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17112319)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 1.88), "[A Cell-Penetrating Peptide Targeting AAC-11 Specifically Induces Cancer Cells Death.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27406828)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 1.7), "[Regulation of mRNA export through API5 and nuclear FGF2 interaction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32383752)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.63), and "[AAC-11, a novel cDNA that inhibits apoptosis after growth factor withdrawal.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9307294)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 1.47). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[API5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000166181-API5) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized to nuclear speckles and is involved in non-specific nuclear processes across various tissues and cell types. API5 is part of Cluster 3 in blood expression, Cluster 16 in tissue expression, Cluster 34 in brain expression, Cluster 24 in cell line expression, and Cluster 49 in single cell expression, all indicating non-specific functions related to transcription and mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624), [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341), and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD105+ endothelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells, superior cervical ganglion, skeletal muscle, atrioventricular node, ciliary ganglion, and skin.




The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.392 (47.07th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -0.027 (50.28th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.007 (70.66th percentile), with a predicted secondary structure composition of 36.64% helix (83.77th percentile), 37.02% sheet (73.19th percentile), and 26.34% turn (32.14th percentile).
