[PFKFB1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000158571-PFKFB1) is a multifunctional enzyme with hydrolase, kinase, and transferase activities. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in some tissues and is involved in basic cellular processes, as indicated by its expression in Cluster 19. In the brain, PFKFB1 is associated with oligodendrocytes and mixed functions (Cluster 13). It is also expressed in connective tissue cells involved in ECM organization (Cluster 44) and hepatocytes involved in metabolism (Cluster 62). The gene is unprognostic for Breast Invasive Carcinoma and Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), each with 3 experiments.
