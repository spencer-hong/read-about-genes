The gene length is 780,108 base pairs (99.33% of all genes), the mature length is 4,757 base pairs (89.07% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 780,068 base pairs (99.76% of all genes).


The gene PRDM5, with NCBI ID 11107, has been the subject of [24 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PRDM5%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2004 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2012 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning PRDM5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[TGF-β2-induced circ-PRDM5 regulates migration, invasion, and EMT through the miR-92b-3p/COL1A2 pathway in human lens epithelial cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35083632)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 2.04), "[PBPK Absorption Modeling of Food Effect and Bioequivalence in Fed State for Two Formulations with Crystalline and Amorphous Forms of BCS 2 Class Drug in Generic Drug Development.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30623248)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 1.94), "[PRDM5 identified as a target of epigenetic silencing in colorectal and gastric cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17699856)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 1.58), "[The epigenetic modifier PRDM5 functions as a tumor suppressor through modulating WNT/β-catenin signaling and is frequently silenced in multiple tumors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22087297)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 1.49), and "[PRDM5 is silenced in human cancers and has growth suppressive activities.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15077163)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 1.33). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[None](https://www.proteinatlas.org/None-None) is a multifunctional gene with roles as an activator, chromatin regulator, DNA-binding protein, methyltransferase, repressor, and transferase. It has been implicated in disease variants and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, nucleoli, and nuclear bodies. Its expression is associated with Cluster 21 in neutrophils, Cluster 16 in non-specific transcription, Cluster 44 in mixed brain function, Cluster 20 in myeloma immune response, and Cluster 18 in early spermatids. The gene's prognostic significance in various cancers is generally unprognostic, including breast invasive carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 70779 and its human ortholog 11107 are associated with several phenotypes. Notably, the gene is linked to abnormal auditory brainstem response and small testis in a sex-specific manner, while abnormal skin morphology is observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.894 (7.64th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 32.47 at pH 7.0 (97.61st percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.009 (78.43rd percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 33.17% helix (60.74th percentile), 26.51% sheet (12.68th percentile), and 23.97% turn (14.84th percentile). The instability index is 57.83 (78.86th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.08 (81.4th percentile). The protein has a length of 630 amino acids (70.76th percentile) and a molecular weight of 73090 Da (72.45th percentile).
