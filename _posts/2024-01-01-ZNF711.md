The gene length is 523,240 base pairs (98.52% of all genes), the mature length is 6,821 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 523,240 base pairs.


ZNF711, with NCBI Gene ID 7552, has been the subject of [8 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ZNF711%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2021.


The top 5 publications mentioning ZNF711, ranked by their relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows. The most influential publication is "[A functional link between the histone demethylase PHF8 and the transcription factor ZNF711 in X-linked mental retardation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20346720)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 2.96). Another notable study is "[ZNF711 down-regulation promotes CISPLATIN resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer via interacting with JHDM2A and suppressing SLC31A1 expression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34521054)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.91). Additionally, "[Clinical findings and a DNA methylation signature in kindreds with alterations in ZNF711.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992252)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 1.46) and "[Mutations in two large pedigrees highlight the role of ZNF711 in X-linked intellectual disability.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993705)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 0.73) are significant contributions to the field. Lastly, "[Fine mapping of Xq11.1-q21.33 and mutation screening of RPS6KA6, ZNF711, ACSL4, DLG3, and IL1RAPL2 for autism spectrum disorders (ASD).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21384559)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 0.28) is also noteworthy. The citation count is sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [DNA-binding](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) is involved in DNA-binding and has been linked to intellectual disability as a disease variant. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the nucleoplasm. The gene is particularly expressed in clusters related to testis and skeletal muscle protein ubiquitination, neuronal synaptic function, neuroblastoma neuronal signaling, and endometrial stromal cell transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.739 (15.11th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -11.10 (20.81st percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.005 (66.04th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 28.65% (21.09th percentile), 30.35% (30.21st percentile), and 27.33% (41.11st percentile), respectively.
