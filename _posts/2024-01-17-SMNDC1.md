The gene is involved in [RNA splicing, via transesterification reactions](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000375) and [mRNA processing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006397), and plays a role in the [apoptotic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006915). It enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). The gene is active in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [Cajal body](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015030), and [nuclear speck](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016607). Additionally, it is part of the [spliceosomal complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005681).


The gene length is 14,859.0 base pairs (34.88% of all genes), the mature length is 1,584.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 14,859.0 base pairs.


The gene SMNDC1 (NCBI ID: 10285) has been mentioned in [10 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SMNDC1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2016.


The top 5 publications mentioning SMNDC1 include "Structural basis for dimethylarginine recognition by the Tudor domains of human SMN and SPF30 proteins." ([title](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22101937) (2011) ......

The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SMNDC1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000119953-SMNDC1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and nuclear bodies. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 7 for blood expression related to the innate immune response, Cluster 4 for tissue expression associated with basic cellular processes in the testis, Cluster 55 for brain expression related to transcription, Cluster 52 for cell line expression related to mitochondria, and Cluster 78 for single cell expression in NK-cells and T-cells involved in the immune system and transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [INTS11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54973), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), and [WDR5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11091) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various immune and blood-related cell types, including CD34+ cells, CD19+ B cells, and whole blood. Additionally, it is found in leukemia promyelocytic cells (HL-60), CD105+ endothelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells, and the thymus.
