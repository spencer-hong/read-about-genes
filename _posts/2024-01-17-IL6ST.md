The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [positive regulation of acute inflammatory response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002675), [positive regulation of adaptive immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0002821), and [cytokine-mediated signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019221). It enables several molecular functions such as [cytokine receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004896), [interleukin-6 receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004915), and [growth factor binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019838). The gene is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576) and is active in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and [membrane raft](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045121). Additionally, it is part of the [interleukin-6 receptor complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005896) and contributes to processes like [positive regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008284) and [positive regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor production](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010575).


The gene length is 21,925 base pairs (44.36% of all genes), the mature length is 1,483 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 21,925 base pairs.


The gene IL6ST (NCBI ID: 3572) has been mentioned in [461 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22IL6ST%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1990 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1999 and 2014. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning IL6ST, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Interleukin-6-type cytokine signalling through the gp130/Jak/STAT pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9716487)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 34.43), "[Molecular cloning and expression of an IL-6 signal transducer, gp130.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2261637)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 26.41), "[Gp130 and the interleukin-6 family of cytokines.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9143707)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 24.68), "[Interleukin-6 family of cytokines and gp130.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7632928)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 24.39), and "[Molecular cloning of APRF, a novel IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 p91-related transcription factor involved in the gp130-mediated signaling pathway.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7512451)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 17.48). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[IL6ST](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000134352-IL6ST) is a receptor involved in cancer-related genes and disease variants, with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. IL6ST is part of Cluster 33 for blood expression, which is non-specific and related to ATP binding. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 11, which is associated with liver plasma proteins. Additionally, IL6ST is found in Cluster 28 for brain expression, related to oligodendrocytes with mixed function, and in Cluster 64 for cell line expression, which involves connective tissue cells and ECM organization. In single-cell expression, it is part of Cluster 37, associated with glandular and luminal cells of unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 6 experiments, [RBPJ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3516) with 5 experiments, [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886) with 5 experiments, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 5 experiments, and [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in adipose tissue and skin according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, CD4+ T cells, smooth muscle, ciliary ganglion, fetal lung, and uterus.


The input data highlights various pathways involving cytokine signaling in the immune system, including ARMS-mediated activation, Frs2-mediated activation, and prolonged ERK activation events. It also covers signaling pathways such as GRB2 and SHC1 events in EGFR and ERBB2 signaling, RAF/MAP kinase cascade, and SOS-mediated signaling. Additionally, the data includes pathways related to leptin, interleukin-6, and VEGFR2-mediated cell proliferation. Signaling by various receptors like EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR, and IGF1R, as well as toll-like receptor cascades, are also prominent. The data encompasses immune system processes, innate immune system, and downstream signal transduction. Furthermore, it includes pathways involved in developmental biology, axon guidance, and NCAM signaling for neurite outgrowth. Lastly, the data touches on disease-related signaling and signal transduction by GPCR.
