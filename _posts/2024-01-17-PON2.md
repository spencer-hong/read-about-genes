The gene enables [arylesterase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004064) and [identical protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042802), and is involved in [response to toxic substance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009636) and [aromatic compound catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019439). It is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576) and the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and enables [metal ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046872) and [acyl-L-homoserine-lactone lactonohydrolase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0102007).


The gene length is 7,111 base pairs (19.26% of all genes), the mature length is 396 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 396 base pairs.


The gene PON2 (NCBI ID: 5445) has been mentioned in [111 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PON2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2007 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning PON2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human paraoxonases (PON1, PON2, and PON3) are lactonases with overlapping and distinct substrate specificities.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15772423)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 12.51), "[Paraoxonase-2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein with antioxidant properties and is capable of preventing cell-mediated oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11579088)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 8.18), "[DNA polymorphisms in two paraoxonase genes (PON1 and PON2) are associated with the risk of coronary heart disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9443862)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 5.2), "[Paraoxonase-2 reduces oxidative stress in vascular cells and decreases endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced caspase activation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17404154)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 4.53), and "[Paraoxonase-2: A potential biomarker for skin cancer aggressiveness.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33210737)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 3.59). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PON2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000105854-PON2) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the brain, specifically in astrocytes, suggesting a role in neuronal signaling. In blood, PON2 is expressed in dendritic cells, although its function in this context is unknown. Additionally, PON2 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells and various cancer cell lines, but its prognostic value in multiple cancer types is unprognostic.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [CEBPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1050) was found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, orofacial cleft, cleft lip, cerebral arterial disease, intracranial arterial disease, intracranial aneurysm, and cerebrovascular disease.


The PON2 gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Apolipoprotein A1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32203549), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Apolipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001053) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, PON2 is associated with [HDL cholesterol](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594039), which directly matches the MeSH term [Cholesterol, HDL](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008076).


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the liver, brain, adrenal gland, and lung, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the amygdala, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, spinal cord, occipital lobe, fetal liver, and fetal lung.
