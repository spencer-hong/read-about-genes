The gene length is 401.0 base pairs (0.27 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 401.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 401.0 base pairs.


The gene POLR2G, with NCBI ID 5436, has been the subject of [21 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLR2G%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1995, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2001 and 2008. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning POLR2G, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Structures of complete RNA polymerase II and its subcomplex, Rpb4/7.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15591044)" (2005) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 2.88, "[Oncogenic EWS-Fli1 interacts with hsRPB7, a subunit of human RNA polymerase II.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9704926)" (1998) with an RCR of 1.95, "[RNA emerging from the active site of RNA polymerase II interacts with the Rpb7 subunit.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16327806)" (2006) with an RCR of 1.27, "[The Rpb7p subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II plays roles in the two major cytoplasmic mRNA decay mechanisms.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17875743)" (2007) with an RCR of 1.2, and "[Identification of the RNA polymerase II subunit hsRPB7 as a novel target of the von Hippel-Lindau protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12912922)" (2003) with an RCR of 1.16. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) with 5 experiments, [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) with 4 experiments, [TRIM24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8805) with 4 experiments, [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757) with 4 experiments, and [MYB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4602) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 67710 and its human ortholog gene 5436 are associated with phenotypes including embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, which is not observed in both sexes, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which is observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.0674 (86.83rd percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -5.16 (33.35th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.995 (20.28th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, turn, and sheet structures of 24.42% (4.08th percentile), 29.07% (56.53rd percentile), and 43.02% (92.32nd percentile), respectively. The instability index is 31.02 (4.94th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 5.33 (14.1st percentile). The protein is 172 amino acids long (10.67th percentile) and has a molecular weight of 19294.10 Da (10.75th percentile).
