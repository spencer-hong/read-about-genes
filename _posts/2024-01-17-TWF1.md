[TWF1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000151239-TWF1) is an actin-binding protein with evidence at the protein level, implicated in disease variants. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localized in the cytosol. TWF1 is expressed in various clusters, including T-cells with unknown function in blood, epithelium-related extracellular exosomes in tissues, oligodendrocytes with mixed function in the brain, non-specific transcription in cell lines, and basal prostatic cells involved in lipid metabolism in single cells.
