The gene length is 462,380 base pairs (98.05% of all genes), the mature length is 10,557 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 462,345 base pairs.


The MEFV gene (NCBI ID: 4210) has been the subject of [620 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MEFV%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1971, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2018.


The top five publications mentioning MEFV, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Innate immune sensing of bacterial modifications of Rho GTPases by the Pyrin inflammasome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24919149)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 17.22), "[AIM2 forms a complex with pyrin and ZBP1 to drive PANoptosis and host defence.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34471287)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 15.45), "[Pyrin inflammasome activation and RhoA signaling in the autoinflammatory diseases FMF and HIDS.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27270401)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 12.91), "[HDAC6 mediates an aggresome-like mechanism for NLRP3 and pyrin inflammasome activation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32943500)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 11.67), and "[De novo CIAS1 mutations, cytokine activation, and evidence for genetic heterogeneity in patients with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID): a new member of the expanding family of pyrin-associated autoinflammatory diseases.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12483741)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 10.11). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [ACTN1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000118082-ACTN1) is involved in actin-binding and has been implicated in amyloidosis, with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in some RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the plasma membrane. The gene is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, particularly in the context of degranulation, and is associated with innate immune responses in lymphoid tissue and bone marrow. It also shows expression in myeloid leukemia cell lines and monocytes at the single-cell level. The gene's prognostic value in various cancers is unprognostic, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and rectum adenocarcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments, followed by [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), each with 3 experiments.





The gene MEFV has been associated with [Ankylosing spondylitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30946743), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Spondylitis, Ankylosing](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013167) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.645 (21.54th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 6.15 at pH 7.0 (71.71st percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.011 (82.6th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 32.27% helix (52.89th percentile), 28.81% sheet (22.28th percentile), and 30.47% turn (67.29th percentile). The instability index is 53.31 (67.51st percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.30 (62.78th percentile). The protein has a length of 781 amino acids (79.79th percentile) and a molecular weight of 86442.76 Da (79.34th percentile).
