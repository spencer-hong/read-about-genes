The gene length is 1,337,016.0 base pairs (99.85th percentile), the mature length is 1,561.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 643,114.0 base pairs.


The gene GJB2 (NCBI ID: 2706) has been the subject of [873 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GJB2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1992, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2005 and 2015.


The top five publications mentioning GJB2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Connexin 26 mutations in hereditary non-syndromic sensorineural deafness.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9139825)" (1997) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 26.91, "[Structure of the connexin 26 gap junction channel at 3.5 A resolution.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19340074)" (2009) with an RCR of 13.12, "[Prelingual deafness: high prevalence of a 30delG mutation in the connexin 26 gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9336442)" (1997) with an RCR of 12.47, "[Connexin-26 mutations in sporadic and inherited sensorineural deafness.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9482292)" (1998) with an RCR of 12.39, and "[GJB2 mutations and degree of hearing loss: a multicenter study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16380907)" (2005) with an RCR of 8.87. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [Gene](https://www.proteinatlas.org/[Ensembl]-[Gene]) is associated with various diseases including deafness, ectodermal dysplasia, ichthyosis, non-syndromic deafness, and palmoplantar keratoderma. Evidence for its involvement is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in mitochondria. It is expressed in squamous epithelium with a role in innate immune response, and in the brain, it is associated with non-specific vasculature. In cell lines, it is expressed in squamous epithelial cells involved in keratinization, and in single cells, it is found in suprabasal keratinocytes involved in cornification.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 5 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 4 experiments, [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 4 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 4 experiments, and [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) with 4 experiments.





The GJB2 gene has been associated with [Hearing loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35661827), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Hearing Loss](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D034381) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.288 (92.01 percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7 is 8.86 (79.03 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.979 (3.86 percentile). The protein has a high affinity for sheet structures (0.469, 96.29 percentile) and a moderate affinity for helix structures (0.283, 19.03 percentile). The instability index is 42.8 (31.42 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 9.11 (82.08 percentile). The protein sequence is 226 amino acids long (18.41 percentile) with a molecular weight of 26214.78 Da (19.68 percentile).
