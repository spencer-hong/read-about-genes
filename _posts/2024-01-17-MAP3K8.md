[MAP3K8](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000107968-MAP3K8) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, functioning as a proto-oncogene. Evidence supports its role at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the cytosol. MAP3K8 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 32 in basophils related to transcription, Cluster 77 in bone marrow associated with cell proliferation, Cluster 12 in the brain related to vasculature, Cluster 55 in lymphoma linked to immune response, and Cluster 29 in monocytes involved in innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 7 experiments, [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065) and [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066) each with 6 experiments, and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) and [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725) each with 5 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as cardiovascular diseases like artery disease, vascular disease, and hypertension. Additionally, there are links to nervous system diseases, specifically central nervous system diseases and neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the data highlights associations with inflammatory bowel disease and other gastrointestinal system diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the fallopian tube, lung, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Lymphoma Burkitt's (Raji), CD56+ NK cells, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscle, and atrioventricular node.


The proteins are involved in various immune-related pathways, including cytokine signaling in the immune system, adaptive immune system processes, and broader immune system functions. Specifically, they participate in CD28 co-stimulation, CD28 dependent PI3K/Akt signaling, and costimulation by the CD28 family. Additionally, these proteins play roles in interleukin-1 signaling and signaling by interleukins.


The mouse ortholog gene 26410 and its human ortholog gene 1326 are associated with abnormal uterus morphology, with this phenotype observed specifically in one sex.
