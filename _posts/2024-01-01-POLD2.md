The gene length is 508.0 base pairs (0.5% of all genes). The mature length is 508.0 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 508.0 base pairs.


The gene POLD2, with NCBI ID 5425, has been featured in [5 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLD2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 2010, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning POLD2, ranked by their relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)), include studies that explore the gene's role in various biological contexts. The RCR measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable publications include "[FF483-484 motif of human Polη mediates its interaction with the POLD2 subunit of Polδ and contributes to DNA damage tolerance.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25662213)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 0.85), "[POLD2 and KSP37 (FGFBP2) correlate strongly with histology, stage and outcome in ovarian carcinomas.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21079801)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 0.69), and "[CAD/POLD2 gene expression is associated with poor overall survival and chemoresistance in bladder urothelial carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30038717)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.45). Additionally, "[Exome sequencing reveals novel rare variants in Iranian familial multiple sclerosis: The importance of POLD2 in the disease pathogenesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34116171)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.38) and "[Identification of Pold2 as a novel interaction partner of protein inhibitor of activated STAT2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22824807)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 0.07) are also significant.

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) with 7 experiments, [RUNX1T1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/862) with 5 experiments, [ELF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1997) with 5 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments, and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 18972 and its human ortholog gene 5425 are associated with phenotypes including embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, which is not observed in both sexes, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which is observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.1113 (77.24th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -12.58 (18.54th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.9981 (32.84th percentile). The protein has a predicted secondary structure composition with 28.99% helix (23.51st percentile), 37.53% sheet (75.99th percentile), and 30.70% turn (68.74th percentile). The instability index is 47.69 (49.03rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.34 (14.54th percentile). The protein is 469 amino acids long (54.33rd percentile) with a molecular weight of 51288.86 Da (53.12th percentile).
