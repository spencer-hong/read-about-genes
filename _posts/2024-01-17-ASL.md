The gene is involved in the [urea cycle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000050) and [arginine metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006525), including the [arginine biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006526) and [arginine biosynthetic process via ornithine](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042450). It enables [argininosuccinate lyase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004056) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), including [identical protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042802). The gene is located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), and is also found in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). Additionally, it is involved in [locomotory behavior](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007626), [post-embryonic development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009791), [ammonia assimilation cycle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019676), and [positive regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045429).


The gene length is 43,854 base pairs (62.83rd percentile), the mature length is 823 base pairs (14.83rd percentile), and the primary transcript length is 18,927 base pairs (50.19th percentile).


The gene ASL (NCBI ID: 435) has been mentioned in [147 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ASL%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning ASL is 1960, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1986 and 2013.


The top 5 publications mentioning ASL, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[ASL perfusion MRI predicts cognitive decline and conversion from MCI to dementia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20220321)" (2010) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 5.48, "[ENZYMES OF ARGININE METABOLISM IN MAMMALIAN CELL CULTURE. I. REPRESSION OF ARGININOSUCCINATE SYNTHETASE AND ARGININOSUCCINASE.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14114834)" (1964) with an RCR of 4.87, "[Epigenetic status of argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase modulates autophagy and cell death in glioblastoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23328665)" (2013) with an RCR of 3.39, "[Simultaneously acquired PET and ASL imaging biomarkers may be helpful in differentiating progression from pseudo-progression in treated gliomas.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33787971)" (2021) with an RCR of 2.62, and "[Cloning and sequence analysis of cDNA for human argininosuccinate lyase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3463959)" (1986) with an RCR of 2.59. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ASL](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000126522-ASL) is a lyase with evidence at the protein level, implicated in disease variants. It is detected in all RNA tissues and primarily localized in the cytosol. The gene shows specific expression patterns, including cluster 25 in blood, cluster 1 in liver and kidney for metabolism, cluster 44 in the brain, cluster 57 in stomach and colon cancer cell lines, and cluster 5 in enterocytes for absorption.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), each with 4 experiments demonstrating their regulatory roles.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including cardiovascular system disease, integumentary system disease, skin disease, and specifically psoriasis.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including liver, colon, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Liver, 721_B_lymphoblasts, Thyroid, Lung, colon, Kidney, and Fetal liver.


The input data highlights pathways involved in metabolism, specifically focusing on the metabolism of amino acids and derivatives, with a particular emphasis on the urea cycle.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.189 (70.31 percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature.
