[SLC25A12](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000115840-SLC25A12) is a gene with evidence at the protein level and is implicated in disease variants. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized to nuclear speckles and the cytosol. The gene is part of Cluster 24 for blood expression, which is non-specific and related to transcription. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 12, associated with heart muscle and cardiac muscle contraction. For brain expression, it is part of Cluster 52, linked to neurons and synapses, with a role in synaptic function. In cell line expression, it is in Cluster 26, which is non-specific but related to mitochondria and RNA binding. Additionally, it is part of Cluster 8 in single-cell expression, associated with neurons and neuronal signaling.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 6 experiments, followed by [E2F6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1876), [CEBPA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1050), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), each with 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including kidney disease, urinary system disease, cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart and muscle, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), prefrontal cortex, B lymphoblasts, whole brain, hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, and temporal lobe.


The input data highlights several key biological processes and diseases, including the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, gluconeogenesis, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial protein import. Additionally, it references specific conditions such as myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora and glycogen storage diseases. These pathways and diseases are interconnected, reflecting the complex interplay between metabolic processes and human health.
