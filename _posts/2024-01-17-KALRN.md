[KALRN](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000160145-KALRN) is a gene with multiple molecular functions, including guanine-nucleotide releasing factor, kinase, serine/threonine-protein kinase, and transferase. It is involved in cancer-related genes and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. KALRN is associated with non-specific basic cellular processes in tissue expression, astrocyte-neuron interactions in brain expression, and digestion in stomach and colon cancer cell lines. In single-cell expression, it is linked to neuronal signaling.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 6 experiments, [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments, [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) with 4 experiments, and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.

The KALRN gene has been associated with several hematological traits through genome-wide association studies. Specifically, it has been linked to [Mean platelet volume](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863252), which maps directly to the MeSH term [Mean Platelet Volume](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D063847). Additionally, KALRN is associated with [Platelet count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), corresponding to the MeSH term [Platelet Count](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D010976). Furthermore, the gene is related to [Platelet large cell ratio](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596262), which maps to the MeSH term [Cells](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D002477) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including blood vessel, uterus, and brain. Additionally, it shows significant expression in various regions of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex, whole brain, medulla oblongata, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, pons, and globus pallidus.
