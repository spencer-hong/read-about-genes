The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [vasculogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001570), [mRNA processing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006397), and [spermatid development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007286). It enables functions such as [DNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003677), [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723), and [mRNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003729). The gene is active in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and is located in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and [cytoplasmic stress granule](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010494). Additionally, it is involved in processes like [positive regulation of gene expression](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010628) and [regulation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010717). The gene also plays a role in [microglia differentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0014004) and [negative regulation of translation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0017148), among other functions.


The gene length is 53,716 base pairs (68.36% of all genes), the mature length is 3,432 base pairs (77.99% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 53,714 base pairs (77.03% of all genes).


The gene QKI, with NCBI ID 9444, has been mentioned in [84 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22QKI%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication mentioning QKI is 1997, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2020. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.

[QKI](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000112531-QKI) is a developmental protein with DNA-binding and RNA-binding molecular functions. It is implicated in cancer-related genes and has evidence at the protein level. QKI is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the nucleoplasm. It is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, involved in degranulation processes, and is associated with basic cellular processes in various tissues. Notably, QKI is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes in the brain and is involved in mixed functions. In cell lines, it is associated with nuclear processes, and in single cells, it is found in oligodendrocytes with an unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942) with 6 experiments, followed by [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [KDM5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10765), [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), each with 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, and various metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, there are links to cardiovascular conditions like coronary artery disease, vascular disease, and myocardial infarction. Mental health disorders, including bipolar disorder and mood disorder, are also implicated.



The gene is expressed in various neural tissues, including the nerve, brain, prefrontal cortex, retina, amygdala, spinal cord, and olfactory bulb. Additionally, it is expressed in immune cell types such as CD33+ myeloid cells and CD14+ monocytes, as well as in whole blood.
