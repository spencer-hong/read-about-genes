The gene is involved in [endonucleolytic cleavage to generate mature 5'-end of SSU-rRNA from (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, LSU-rRNA)](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000472) and [endonucleolytic cleavage in 5'-ETS of tricistronic rRNA transcript (SSU-rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, LSU-rRNA)](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000480). It enables [RNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003723) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). The gene is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654) and is active in the [nucleolus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005730). It is part of the [90S preribosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030686) and the [small-subunit processome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032040). Additionally, it enables [U3 snoRNA binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0034511) and is involved in [ribosomal small subunit biogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042274).


The gene length is 28,606 base pairs (51.39% of all genes), the mature length is 3,102.5 base pairs (73.9% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 24,226.5 base pairs (57.05% of all genes).


The gene TBL3 (NCBI ID: 10607) has been mentioned in [1 publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TBL3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 2012, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2012 to 2012.


The top publication mentioning TBL3 is "[Tbl3 regulates cell cycle length during zebrafish development.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22659140)" (2012) (relative citation ratio of 0.33). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TBL3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000183751-TBL3) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the nucleoli and is associated with non-specific ATP binding in blood expression clusters. In tissue expression clusters, it is involved in non-specific transcription, while in brain expression clusters, it is associated with neurons of mixed function. Additionally, TBL3 is involved in non-specific transcription in cell line expression clusters and mixed function in single cell expression clusters.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 6 experiments, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 5 experiments, [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) with 5 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, and [GATA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the uterus and skin, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, liver, 721_B_lymphoblasts, thyroid, CD105+ endothelial cells, prostate, lung, and testis.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.097 (78.33rd percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -5.99 (31.02nd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.993 (15.77th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix and sheet structures, with affinities of 0.335 (63.99th percentile) and 0.370 (73.04th percentile), respectively, and a turn affinity of 0.238 (13.73rd percentile). The instability index is 45.20 (40.07th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.44 (41.31st percentile). The protein is 808 amino acids long (81.08th percentile) with a molecular weight of 89033.65 Da (80.59th percentile).
