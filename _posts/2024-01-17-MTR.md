The gene length is 12,656 base pairs (30.9% of all genes), the mature length is 548 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 11,590 base pairs.


The gene MTR (NCBI ID: 4548) has been mentioned in [189 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MTR%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning MTR was in 1977, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2012.


The top 5 publications mentioning MTR, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Human methionine synthase: cDNA cloning and identification of mutations in patients of the cblG complementation group of folate/cobalamin disorders.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8968737)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 9.57), "[Cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2407589)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 7.62), "[Genetic polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and methionine synthase, folate levels in red blood cells, and risk of neural tube defects.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10323741)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 5.67), "[Methionine synthase D919G polymorphism is a significant but modest determinant of circulating homocysteine concentrations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10520212)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 5.38), and "[A polymorphism of the methionine synthase gene: association with plasma folate, vitamin B12, homocyst(e)ine, and colorectal cancer risk.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10498402)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 5.2). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MTR](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000116984-MTR) is a gene encoding a protein with methyltransferase and transferase molecular functions. It is involved in diseases and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. The protein has been detected at the protein level and is expressed in all tissues. Subcellularly, it is localized to microtubules, the cytokinetic bridge, primary cilium, basal body, and cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 3 in blood, Cluster 51 in thyroid gland tissue, Cluster 30 in brain white matter, Cluster 45 in cell lines, and Cluster 37 in glandular and luminal cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data highlights associations with various disease conditions, including several types of cancer such as colorectal cancer, intestinal cancer, large intestine cancer, gastrointestinal system cancer, and general cancer. Additionally, it includes cardiovascular conditions like coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and cardiovascular system disease. Mental health disorders are also represented, including cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, mood disorder, substance-related disorder, substance dependence, alcohol dependence, and nicotine dependence. Furthermore, the data encompasses arteriosclerosis, arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and atherosclerosis.



The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including nerve and thyroid, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, thyroid, CD8+ T cells, leukemia promyelocytic-HL-60 cells, CD105+ endothelial cells, and uterus.


The input data highlights various pathways and disorders related to metabolism and biological oxidations. Key pathways include biological oxidations, phase II conjugation, methylation, and metabolism of vitamins and cofactors. Notable disorders linked to defective proteins include hypermethioninemia with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency (HMAHCHD), hyperbilirubinemia caused by defective UGT1A1 and UGT1A4, hemolytic anemia due to gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency (HAGGSD), glutathionuria (GLUTH), glutathione synthetase deficiency (GSS deficiency), methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency (MATD), 5-oxoprolinase deficiency (OPLAHD), Schneckenbecken dysplasia (SCHBCKD), and thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency (TPMT deficiency). Additionally, the data covers cobalamin (vitamin B12) transport and metabolism, with disorders such as hereditary megaloblastic anemia 1, biotidinase deficiency, methylmalonic aciduria, and intrinsic factor deficiency. The data also includes defects in biotin and cobalamin metabolism, sulfur amino acid metabolism, and metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes.
