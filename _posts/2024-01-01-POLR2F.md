The gene length is 403 base pairs (0.28 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 403 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 403 base pairs.


The gene POLR2F, with NCBI ID 5435, has been the subject of [4 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLR2F%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2005 and 2016.


The top publications mentioning POLR2F include "[Three human RNA polymerases interact with TFIIH via a common RPB6 subunit.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34268577)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 1.64), "[POLR2F, ATP6V0A1 and PRNP expression in colorectal cancer: new molecules with prognostic significance?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18505059)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 0.92), and "[Human RNA polymerase II-associated protein 2 (RPAP2) interacts directly with the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb6 and participates in pre-mRNA 3&apos;-end formation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25639305)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 0.37). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.674 (19.41% percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -20.45 (10.82% percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.014 (89.26% percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (37.01%, 85.22% percentile) and a moderate affinity for sheet structures (31.50%, 36.62% percentile) and turn structures (29.92%, 63.32% percentile). The instability index is 45.45 (40.89% percentile), and the isoelectric point is 4.11 (0.27% percentile). The protein sequence is 127 amino acids long (5.42% percentile) with a molecular weight of 14477.92 Da (5.81% percentile).
