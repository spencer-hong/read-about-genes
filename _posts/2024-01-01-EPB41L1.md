The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341) with 4 experiments, [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 4 experiments, [HNRNPK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3190) with 4 experiments, and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 13821 and its human ortholog gene 2036 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Notably, these include abnormal iris pigmentation, which is not observed in both sexes, as well as hyperactivity, increased exploration in new environments, increased fasting circulating glucose levels, and an increased startle reflex, all of which are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.796 (11.86th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -26.45 (7.43rd percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.012 (86.76th percentile), suggesting high flexibility. The protein has a propensity for helical structures (33.03%, 59.56th percentile), with lower tendencies for sheet (29.85%, 27.47th percentile) and turn (30.19%, 65.21st percentile) conformations. The instability index is 49.72 (56.3rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.43 (16.44th percentile). The sequence length is 881 amino acids (83.82nd percentile), with a molecular weight of 98501.71 Da (83.83rd percentile).
