The gene length is 3,328 base pairs (9.32% of all genes), the mature length is 491 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 3,278 base pairs.


The gene MARK1 (NCBI ID: 4139) has been mentioned in [1,181 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MARK1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1872, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1994 and 2016.


The top 5 publications mentioning MARK1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The Polycomb complex PRC2 and its mark in life.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21248841)" (2011) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 51.46, "[GeneMark.hmm: new solutions for gene finding.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9461475)" (1998) with an RCR of 24.02, "[Reporting recommendations for tumor marker prognostic studies (REMARK).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16106022)" (2005) with an RCR of 23.27, "[LKB1 is a master kinase that activates 13 kinases of the AMPK subfamily, including MARK/PAR-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14976552)" (2004) with an RCR of 18.81, and "[Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK): explanation and elaboration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22675273)" (2012) with an RCR of 17.75. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MARK1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000116141-MARK1) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, implicated in autism and autism spectrum disorder. Evidence supports its function at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the pituitary gland related to hormone signaling, the choroid plexus with mixed functions, squamous epithelial cells involved in keratinization, and neurons associated with neuronal signaling.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 7 experiments, followed by [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869), [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), each with 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, and myocardial infarction.


The gene MARK1 has been associated with [Insulin-like growth factor 1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Growth](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006128) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, data from the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pineal gland (both day and night), fetal brain, uterus corpus, and testis (seminiferous tubule and germ cells).
