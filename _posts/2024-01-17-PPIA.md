[PPIA](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196262-PPIA) is a gene encoding a protein with isomerase and rotamase molecular functions. It is an FDA-approved drug target with evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is notably expressed in brain tissue, specifically in neurons involved in synaptic function. Additionally, PPIA is part of blood expression cluster 13, which is non-specific but related to mitochondria. The gene is also associated with various cell line and single-cell expression clusters, although its subcellular location is not specified.

The input data highlights various pathways related to HIV infection and its life cycle, including the integration of provirus, early and late phases of the HIV life cycle, APOBEC3G-mediated resistance, binding and entry of the HIV virion, reverse transcription of HIV RNA, uncoating of the HIV virion, plus-strand DNA synthesis, assembly of the HIV virion, budding and maturation of the HIV virion, and host interactions of HIV factors. Additionally, the data covers pathways related to disease, basigin interactions, cell surface interactions at the vascular wall, hemostasis, platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, platelet degranulation, and the response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca2+.


The mouse ortholog gene 268373, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 5478, is associated with various phenotypic abnormalities in both sexes. These include abnormal morphologies of the colon, eye, kidney, and spleen, as well as decreased body length and heart weight. Additionally, the gene is linked to enlarged spleen, increased circulating alkaline phosphatase levels, increased mean platelet volume, increased spleen weight, megacolon, microphthalmia, and small kidney size.
