The gene is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576) and is part of the [membrane attack complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005579). It is active in the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615) and located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). The gene is involved in [complement activation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006956), including both the [alternative pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006957) and the [classical pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006958). Additionally, it plays a role in the [killing of cells of another organism](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031640) and the [positive regulation of immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050778).


The gene length is 231,653 base pairs (93.91% of all genes), the mature length is 11,637.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 230,325 base pairs (96.73% of all genes).


The gene C7 (NCBI ID: 730) has been mentioned in [39 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22C7%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning C7 was in 1975, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1994 and 2013.


The top five publications mentioning C7, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The structure of human complement component C7 and the C5b-7 complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3335508)" (1988) (relative citation ratio: 3.85), "[Clusterin, the human apolipoprotein and complement inhibitor, binds to complement C7, C8 beta, and the b domain of C9.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8345200)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 2.93), "[*Complement C7* is a novel risk gene for Alzheimer's disease in Han Chinese.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31032141)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 2.11), "[Synthesis of complement components C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 in vitro by human monocytes and assembly of the terminal complement complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3764345)" (1986) (relative citation ratio: 1.43), and "[Complement C7 is Specifically Expressed in Mesangial Cells and is a Potential Diagnostic Biomarker for Diabetic Nephropathy and is Regulated by miR-494-3p and miR-574-5p.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34262312)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.25). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[C7](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000112936-C7) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in adipose tissue, immune cells, connective tissue cells, and fibroblasts, where it is involved in ECM organization and immune response. The gene's expression has been found to be unprognostic in various cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney chromophobe, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, ovary serous cystadenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, testicular germ cell tumor, and thyroid carcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [ASCL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/429), [CDX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1045), and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), each shown to be regulating in 2 experiments.

The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the ovary, fallopian tube, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the pancreatic islet, adrenal cortex, adrenal gland, appendix, ovary, uterus, and lymph node.


The input data highlights several pathways related to the immune system, including the innate immune system, regulation of the complement cascade, the terminal pathway of complement, and the complement cascade itself.


The mouse ortholog gene 109828 and its human ortholog gene 730 are associated with abnormal coat/hair morphology and abnormal lens morphology, with these phenotypes observed in both sexes.
