The gene CAP2, with NCBI ID 10486, has been mentioned in [28 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CAP2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1978, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2007 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning CAP2, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[2'-O-ribose methylation of cap2 in human: function and evolution in a horizontally mobile family.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21310715)" (2011) (RCR: 2.03), "[Cyclase-associated protein 2 dimerization regulates cofilin in synaptic plasticity and Alzheimer's disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094279)" (2020) (RCR: 1.73), "[The mRNA Cap 2'-<i>O</i>-Methyltransferase CMTR1 Regulates the Expression of Certain Interferon-Stimulated Genes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32404510)" (2020) (RCR: 1.54), "[A homozygous CAP2 pathogenic variant in a neonate presenting with rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy and nemaline rods.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862840)" (2022) (RCR: 1.49), and "[Structural insight into the recognition of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and sinefungin in SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16/Nsp10 RNA cap 2'-O-Methyltransferase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33020707)" (2020) (RCR: 1.43). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CAP2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000112186-CAP2) is a gene involved in various diseases, including cancer and cardiomyopathy. It has been detected at the protein level and is expressed in multiple tissues, with notable expression in skeletal muscle related to muscle contraction, neurons with mixed functions, and smooth muscle cells. The gene is localized in the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, and cytosol. Despite its involvement in disease, CAP2 does not show prognostic significance in various cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 5 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments, [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) with 4 experiments, [NELFE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7936) with 4 experiments, and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as male reproductive organ cancer, prostate cancer, and organ system cancer. Additionally, respiratory diseases like lower respiratory tract disease and lung disease are noted. Cardiovascular conditions, including artery disease, vascular disease, and hypertension, are also represented. Neurological disorders such as neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia are highlighted, along with mental health conditions like bipolar disorder and mood disorder. Furthermore, the data includes eye diseases, specifically retinal degeneration and age-related macular degeneration.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle and brain. According to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles, the gene is detected in muscle and brain samples. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate that the gene is expressed in multiple brain regions such as the Prefrontal Cortex, Amygdala, Whole brain, Subthalamic Nucleus, Temporal Lobe, and Medulla Oblongata, as well as in Skeletal Muscle.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including signaling by Robo receptor, the role of Abl in Robo-Slit signaling, axon guidance, and developmental biology.


The mouse ortholog gene 67252 and its human ortholog gene 10486 are associated with phenotypes including abnormal locomotor activation and cataract, with these effects observed in both sexes.
