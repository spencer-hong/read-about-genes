[SDC4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000124145-SDC4) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. SDC4 is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 9 in blood (T-regs - Cell cycle regulation), Cluster 37 in tissues (Liver & Intestine - Lipid metabolism), Cluster 19 in the brain (Astrocytes - Mixed function), Cluster 53 in cell lines (Squamous epithelial cells - Keratinization), and Cluster 45 in single cells (Non-specific - Mixed function).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 5 experiments, [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869) with 4 experiments, [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 4 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 4 experiments, and [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, and general disease categories. These findings highlight the potential genetic underpinnings of various respiratory and broader disease conditions.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the liver and lung, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the liver, bronchial epithelial cells, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung, adrenal cortex, and kidney.


The input data includes various pathways and diseases related to carbohydrate metabolism, glycosaminoglycan metabolism, and glycosylation. Notable conditions include Myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora, Glycogen storage diseases, and several types of Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), such as Sly syndrome, Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, and various forms of Sanfilippo syndrome. Additionally, the data covers defects in specific genes like B3GAT3, B4GALT1, and CHST14, which are associated with conditions like JDSSDHD, B4GALT1-CDG (CDG-2d), and EDS, musculocontractural type, respectively. The data also includes pathways related to visual transduction, retinoid metabolism, signal transduction, and extracellular matrix organization.
