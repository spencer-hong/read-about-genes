[CCND2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000118971-CCND2) is a cyclin involved in cancer-related processes, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and primarily localizes to the nucleoplasm. CCND2 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 3 for non-specific nuclear processes in blood, Cluster 7 for mixed function in adipose tissue, Cluster 51 for mixed function in neurons, Cluster 21 for adaptive immune response in lymphoma cell lines, and Cluster 50 for ECM organization in connective tissue cells.

The mouse ortholog gene 12444 and its human ortholog gene 894 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal cranium morphology, abnormal spine curvature, decreased total body fat amount, increased circulating alkaline phosphatase level, increased circulating glucose level, increased fasting circulating glucose level, and increased lean body mass. Additionally, males specifically present with small testis.
