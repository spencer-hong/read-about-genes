[VGLL4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000144560-VGLL4) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli fibrillar center. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood expression related to cell proliferation, Cluster 62 for tissue expression involved in ECM organization, Cluster 23 for brain expression in the choroid plexus with mixed function, Cluster 8 for cell line expression related to basic cellular processes, and Cluster 6 for single cell expression in ovarian stromal cells involved in transcription.
