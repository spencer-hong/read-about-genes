[PRKCI](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000163558-PRKCI) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, playing a crucial role in various molecular functions. It is implicated in cancer-related processes, serving as a proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor, and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence supports its function at the protein level. PRKCI is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in microtubules, the cytokinetic bridge, primary cilium, and cytosol. Its expression is notable in various clusters, including those related to nuclear processes in blood, vesicular transport in the parathyroid gland, synaptic function in the brain, membrane components in kidney cancer cell lines, and lung function in single-cell alveolar cells.

Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in the prefrontal cortex, thyroid, promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), fetal brain, and bronchial epithelial cells.


The input data highlights several pathways involving p75NTR, including its recruitment of signaling complexes and signaling via NF-kB. Additionally, the data covers signaling by NGF, p75NTR receptor-mediated signaling, and broader processes such as signal transduction and cell junction organization. Cell-cell junction organization and communication, as well as tight junction interactions, are also noted.
