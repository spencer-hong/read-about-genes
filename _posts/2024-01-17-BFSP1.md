The gene enables [structural constituent of cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005200) and [structural constituent of eye lens](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005212), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is active in and located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and [intermediate filament](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005882). Additionally, it is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and [cell cortex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005938). The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [intermediate filament organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045109), [cell maturation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048469), and [lens fiber cell development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070307).


The gene length is 41,108 base pairs (61.01% of all genes), the mature length is 663 base pairs (7.86% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 35,085 base pairs (66.77% of all genes).


The gene BFSP1 (NCBI ID: 631) has been mentioned in [29 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22BFSP1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1991 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1995 and 2010. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning BFSP1, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies on the assembly properties of lens proteins CP49 and CP115, which coassemble with alpha-crystallin but not with vimentin ([In vitro studies on the assembly properties of the lens proteins CP49, CP115: coassembly with alpha-crystallin but not with vimentin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7781747) (1995), relative citation ratio: 2.85), the distinct networks formed by vimentin and CP49/filensin in the lens ([Vimentin and CP49/filensin form distinct networks in the lens which are independently modulated during lens fibre cell differentiation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7615661) (1995), relative citation ratio: 2.67), the characterization of filensin as a vimentin-binding protein ([Filensin: a new vimentin-binding, polymerization-competent, and membrane-associated protein of the lens fiber cell.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1918147) (1991), relative citation ratio: 2.59), the structural similarity of bovine filensin to intermediate filament proteins ([Bovine filensin possesses primary and secondary structure similarity to intermediate filament proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8491777) (1993), relative citation ratio: 2.37), and the association of a mutation in BFSP1 with autosomal recessive juvenile onset cataract ([Autosomal recessive juvenile onset cataract associated with mutation in BFSP1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17225135) (2007), relative citation ratio: 2.13). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[BFSP1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000125864-BFSP1) is an eye lens protein with evidence at the protein level, implicated in cataract development. It is detected in many tissues and localizes to the plasma membrane and cytosol. BFSP1 is expressed in various clusters, including T-cells of unknown function in blood, endocrine and neural tissues of unknown function, neurons with mixed function in the brain, skin cancer cell lines involved in ECM organization, and spermatogonia related to spermatogenesis in single-cell analysis.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), [HDAC2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3066), [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), and [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancer. Additionally, the data highlights respiratory system diseases, including lung disease and lower respiratory tract disease. Cardiovascular system diseases, such as coronary artery disease, artery disease, and vascular disease, are also represented. Furthermore, the data includes kidney disease, urinary system disease, and cognitive disorders, specifically bipolar disorder and mood disorder. Metabolic disorders, including inherited metabolic disorders and lipid metabolism disorders, are also noted. Lastly, the data mentions cerebrovascular disease and arteriosclerosis.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Bronchial Epithelial Cells, Appendix, Superior Cervical Ganglion, Skeletal Muscle, and Uterus Corpus.



The mouse ortholog gene 12075 and its human ortholog gene 631 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal eye morphology. Additionally, females specifically show an enlarged uterus and a small superior vagus ganglion.
