The gene length is 8,008 base pairs (21.29% of all genes), the mature length is 2,322 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 6,501 base pairs (60.23% of all genes).


The gene RPS8, with NCBI ID 6202, has been featured in [6 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RPS8%22) (count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1972, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1996 and 2016.


The top five publications mentioning RPS8, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows. The most influential publication is "[The intrinsic flexibility of the aptamer targeting the ribosomal protein S8 is a key factor for the molecular recognition.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29413905)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 1.01). Another notable study is "[RPS8--a new informative DNA marker for phylogeny of Babesia and Theileria parasites in China.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24244571)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.0). Additionally, "[Identification of 40S ribosomal protein S8 as a novel biomarker for alcohol‑associated hepatocellular carcinoma using weighted gene co‑expression network analysis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32627011)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 0.97) and "[Optimal conditions for the interaction of ribosomal protein S8 and 16S RNA and studies on the reaction mechanism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4567808)" (1972) (relative citation ratio: 0.74) are significant contributions to the field. Lastly, "[CDK11p46 and RPS8 associate with each other and suppress translation in a synergistic manner.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21371428)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 0.31) is also noteworthy.
