[SCN4B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000177098-SCN4B) is a gene encoding a voltage-gated sodium channel, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. It is implicated in diseases such as atrial fibrillation and Long QT syndrome, and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. The gene is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in skeletal muscle, neurons, and synapses, where it plays roles in muscle contraction and synaptic function. Additionally, SCN4B is expressed in smooth muscle cells, contributing to signal transduction. While its prognostic value in various cancers is generally unprognostic, it is particularly notable for its unprognostic status in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.
