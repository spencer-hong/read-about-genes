[PRNP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000171867-PRNP) is a gene encoding a prion protein, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. It is implicated in amyloidosis and disease variants. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is localized to the nuclear membrane, vesicles, and cytosol. PRNP is expressed in various clusters, including basophils with unknown function, choroid plexus involved in transmembrane transport, and Schwann cells & melanocytes with mixed function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including nervous system diseases, central nervous system diseases, and diseases of mental health. Specifically, it highlights substance-related disorders, with a particular focus on substance dependence and alcohol dependence. Additionally, the data points to brain diseases, notably Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and prion diseases.


The PRNP gene has been associated with several neurological conditions. Notably, it has been linked to [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19081515), which is closely related to the MeSH term [Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007562). Additionally, the gene has been implicated in [Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sporadic)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32949544), mapped to the MeSH term [Brain Diseases](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001927) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Furthermore, PRNP is associated with [Prion diseases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22210626), which directly matches the MeSH term [Prion Diseases](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D017096).


The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the Amygdala, Occipital Lobe, Cerebellum Peduncles, and Globus Pallidus.


The proteins are involved in several key pathways, including axon guidance, developmental biology, NCAM signaling for neurite outgrowth, and NCAM1 interactions.
