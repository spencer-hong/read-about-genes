The gene is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and is active in this component. It is involved in [sodium ion transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006814) and [sulfate transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008272). The gene enables [monoatomic anion:sodium symporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015373) and [sodium:sulfate symporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015382). Additionally, it is located in the [apical plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016324) and is involved in [sodium ion transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0035725), [transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0055085), [monoatomic anion transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0098656), and [sulfate transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902358).


The gene length is 42,119 base pairs (61.65% of all genes), the mature length is 1,005 base pairs (22.73% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 23,712 base pairs (56.54% of all genes).


The gene SLC13A1 (NCBI ID: 6561) has been mentioned in [19 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLC13A1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2002 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2004 and 2014. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top publications mentioning SLC13A1 include "[Rare SLC13A1 variants associate with intervertebral disc disorder highlighting role of sulfate in disc pathology.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35110524)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 3.62), "[Hyposulfatemia, growth retardation, reduced fertility, and seizures in mice lacking a functional NaSi-1 gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14578452)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 1.69), "[Roles of Slc13a1 and Slc26a1 sulfate transporters of eel kidney in sulfate homeostasis and osmoregulation in freshwater.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15802556)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.99), "[Disruption of NaS1 sulfate transport function in mice leads to enhanced acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16729303)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 0.88), and "[NaSi-1 and Sat-1: structure, function and transcriptional regulation of two genes encoding renal proximal tubular sulfate transporters.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15833267)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.72). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SLC13A1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000081800-SLC13A1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, and it is notably expressed in the kidney, where it is involved in transmembrane transport (Cluster 52). At the single-cell level, it is particularly expressed in proximal tubular cells, also associated with transmembrane transport (Cluster 38). The gene is unprognostic for Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma and Kidney Renal Papillary Cell Carcinoma in TCGA datasets.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [ME1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4199), each with 2 experiments. Additionally, [NUP98](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4928), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) were each found to be regulating in 1 experiment.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, as well as hematopoietic and immune system diseases like leukopenia and leukocyte disease. Metabolic disorders, particularly those related to carbohydrate and glucose metabolism, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, are also implicated. Cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, and myocardial infarction are noted. Additionally, the data highlights nervous system diseases, specifically neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease and tauopathy, along with cognitive disorders and developmental disorders of mental health, including autism spectrum disorder.


The SLC13A1 gene has been associated with [ICD10 M51: Intervertebral disc disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35110524), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Spondylosis](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D055009) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, it has been linked to [Sulfate levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35347128), which corresponds to the MeSH term [Sulfates](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D013431) through embedding match.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the colon, small intestine, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in cardiac myocytes, heart, appendix, superior cervical ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscle, and atrioventricular node.


The input data highlights various pathways involving SLC-mediated transmembrane transport, including the transport of small molecules, glucose and other sugars, bile salts and organic acids, metal ions, and amine compounds. Specifically, it mentions bile salt and organic anion SLC transporters, as well as sodium-coupled sulphate, di- and tri-carboxylate transporters.
