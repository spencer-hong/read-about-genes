The gene length is 3,492 base pairs (9.71% of all genes). The mature length and primary transcript length are also 3,492 base pairs.


The gene CD55 (NCBI ID: 1604) has been mentioned in [352 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CD55%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1966 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1995 and 2010. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning CD55, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Validity and between-day reliability of the cervical range of motion (CROM) device.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20436238)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 10.72), "[Distribution of decay-accelerating factor in the peripheral blood of normal individuals and patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2409211)" (1985) (relative citation ratio: 9.72), "[Release of decay-accelerating factor (DAF) from the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC).

The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CD55](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196352-CD55) is a multifunctional gene with roles as a blood group antigen, host cell receptor for virus entry, and a receptor. It is implicated in disease variants and has evidence at the protein level. CD55 is detected in all tissues and is notably expressed in neutrophils, adipose tissue, oligodendrocytes, squamous epithelial cells, and monocytes. Its expression is associated with protein binding, mixed functions, keratinization, and innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624), [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [SMARCB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6598) and [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908) were found to be regulating in 5 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of respiratory conditions, including asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, and respiratory system disease. Additionally, the data highlights links to broader disease categories such as disease and disease of anatomical entity. Notably, there are also associations with cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, bipolar disorder, and mood disorder.



The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the adrenal gland, lung, and blood, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), CD14+ monocytes, whole blood, lung, placenta, salivary gland, adrenal cortex, and fetal lung.


The input data highlights several pathways from Reactome, including those involved in the immune system, particularly the innate immune system and the regulation of the complement cascade. Additionally, it covers the complement cascade itself and the class B/2 secretin family receptors. The data also includes pathways related to defective ACTH causing obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (POMCD), GPCR ligand binding, metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes, and general disease processes. Furthermore, signaling by GPCR and signal transduction pathways are mentioned.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.306 (57.32nd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 1.804 at pH 7.0 (56.79th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.005 (64.09th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 23.88% helix (3.39th percentile), 38.06% sheet (78.84th percentile), and 33.07% turn (82.24th percentile). The instability index is 48.59 (52.32nd percentile), with an isoelectric point of 7.79 (57.03rd percentile). The protein has a length of 381 amino acids (42.77th percentile) and a molecular weight of 41399.69 Da (41.31st percentile).
