The gene is part of the [protein phosphatase type 2A complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000159) and enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is active in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and enables [protein phosphatase regulator activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019888).


The gene length is 72,966 base pairs (75.49th percentile), the mature length is 4,809 base pairs (89.34th percentile), and the primary transcript length is 72,966 base pairs (83.2nd percentile).


The gene PPP2R2C (NCBI ID: 5522) has been mentioned in [10 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PPP2R2C%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2000 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2012 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning PPP2R2C, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that highlight the gene's role in various cancers and its association with insulin resistance. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable works include "[PPP2R2C loss promotes castration-resistance and is associated with increased prostate cancer-specific mortality.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23493267)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.1), "[MiR-572 prompted cell proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells by suppressing PPP2R2C expression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26796271)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 1.09), and "[High genetic risk scores of SLIT3, PLEKHA5 and PPP2R2C variants increased insulin resistance and interacted with coffee and caffeine consumption in middle-aged adults.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30454882)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 0.98).

[PPP2R2C](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000074211-PPP2R2C) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many tissues. It is primarily localized in the cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 9 in oligodendrocytes related to myelination, Cluster 40 in astrocytes involved in astrocyte-neuron interactions, Cluster 7 in liver cancer associated with metabolism, and Cluster 34 in neurons related to neuronal signaling.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 4 experiments, and [ME1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4199) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as viral infectious diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infectious disease. Additionally, there are associations with hematopoietic and immune system diseases, including leukocyte disease, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis. Metabolic disorders are also implicated, specifically diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and carbohydrate metabolism diseases. Cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, vascular disease, and hypertension are noted. Furthermore, the data highlights nervous system diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Other conditions include kidney disease, eye diseases, and endocrine system diseases such as hypothyroidism.



The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the amygdala, whole brain, fetal brain, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, subthalamic nucleus, medulla oblongata, and occipital lobe. Additionally, it is expressed in the pituitary gland.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.562 (28.6% percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -9.92 (22.63% percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.002 (48.97% percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 29.31% (25.84% percentile), 34.90% (58.28% percentile), and 29.98% (63.78% percentile), respectively. The instability index is 45.11 (39.68% percentile), with an isoelectric point of 5.92 (28.58% percentile). The protein is 447 amino acids long (51.55% percentile) and has a molecular weight of 51514.42 Da (53.35% percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, which can be found [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
