The gene length is 62,091 base pairs (71.74th percentile), the mature length is 1,822 base pairs (47.83rd percentile), and the primary transcript length is 60,215 base pairs (79.43rd percentile).


The gene B2M (NCBI ID: 567) has been the subject of [2,987 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22B2M%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication dating back to 1964. The middle 50% of these publications were published between 1986 and 2005.


The top five publications mentioning B2M, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A new form of amyloid protein associated with chronic hemodialysis was identified as beta 2-microglobulin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3893430)" (1985) (relative citation ratio: 28.01), "[Effect of control of blood glucose on urinary excretion of albumin and beta2 microglobulin in insulin-dependent diabetes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/84336)" (1979) (relative citation ratio: 23.65), "[Normal luminal bacteria, especially Bacteroides species, mediate chronic colitis, gastritis, and arthritis in HLA-B27/human beta2 microglobulin transgenic rats.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8770866)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 15.25), "[beta 2-Microglobulin modified with advanced glycation end products is a major component of hemodialysis-associated amyloidosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8376584)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 11.58), and "[No change in corrected beta 2-microglobulin concentration after cuprophane haemodialysis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2881162)" (1987) (relative citation ratio: 10.56). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667), and [KDM2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/84678), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.


Based on the data from GTRD's database of transcription factor (TF) binding sites and filtered for Perturb-seq data, several TFs were identified as significant regulators in multiple experiments. Notably, [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) and [IRF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623) were each found to regulate gene expression in 2 experiments. [ZNF274](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), [KLF10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872), and [HIVEP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) were identified in 3 experiments each. Additionally, [ZNF384](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8243) was found in 2 experiments, while [ZNF629](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6426), [ZNF783](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6749), [ZNF787](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6830), [ZNF804A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861), [ZNF845](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57634), and [ZNF879](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) were each identified in 1 experiment.





The mouse ortholog gene 12010 and its human ortholog gene 567 are associated with several phenotypes. Both sexes exhibit abnormal skin morphology, preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, and preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance. Additionally, female mice show embryonic lethality prior to the tooth bud stage, hydrometra, and a small superior vagus ganglion.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.376 (48.99th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -2.15 (42.59th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.997 (27.64th percentile). The protein's secondary structure tends to be 31.93% helix (49.72nd percentile) and 37.82% sheet (77.52nd percentile), with 28.57% turn (52.36th percentile). The instability index is 33.82 (8.25th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.06 (32.01st percentile). The protein is 119 amino acids long (4.59th percentile) with a molecular weight of 13714.4 Da (4.98th percentile).
