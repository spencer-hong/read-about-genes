[NRXN1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000179915-NRXN1) is a gene implicated in intellectual disability and schizophrenia, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily located in the plasma membrane. NRXN1 is expressed in neutrophils of unknown function (Cluster 21) and is notably involved in synaptic signal transduction in the brain (Cluster 22). In neurons, it is associated with nucleosome functions (Cluster 2) and neuronal signaling (Cluster 34). The gene's expression in cancer prognostics is generally unprognostic, as seen in breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, lung squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and testicular germ cell tumor.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146), [INTS11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54973), and [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as viral infectious diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infectious disease. Additionally, the data highlights various types of cancer, including lung cancer and respiratory system cancer, as well as hematopoietic and immune system diseases. Metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, are also prominent. Cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and hypertension, are noted, along with kidney diseases and urinary system disorders. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are included, as well as mental health conditions like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance dependence. Other notable conditions include obesity, anemia, sleep disorders, and multiple sclerosis.


The gene NRXN1 has been associated with body weight regulation through genome-wide association studies. Specifically, it has been linked to [BMI (standard GWA)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37106081), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Overweight](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D050177) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, NRXN1 has been associated with [Body mass index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239722), which directly matches the MeSH term [Body Mass Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015992).


The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including nerve and brain. Additionally, it is expressed in various regions of the brain such as the amygdala, fetal brain, subthalamic nucleus, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and globus pallidus.


The proteins are involved in extracellular matrix organization and non-integrin membrane-ECM interactions.


The mouse ortholog gene 18189 and its human ortholog 9378 are associated with several phenotypic traits, including decreased circulating alkaline phosphatase level, decreased grip strength, and tremors, all of which are observed in both sexes.
