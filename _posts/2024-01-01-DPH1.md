The gene length is 451,356 base pairs (97.97% of all genes), the mature length is 1,777.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 449,465.5 base pairs.


The gene DPH1 (NCBI ID: 1801) has been the subject of [22 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DPH1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1999 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2007 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning DPH1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Dph3 is an electron donor for Dph1-Dph2 in the first step of eukaryotic diphthamide biosynthesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24422557)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 1.63), "[The amidation step of diphthamide biosynthesis in yeast requires DPH6, a gene identified through mining the DPH1-DPH5 interaction network.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23468660)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.27), "[Matching two independent cohorts validates DPH1 as a gene responsible for autosomal recessive intellectual disability with short stature, craniofacial, and ectodermal anomalies.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26220823)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 0.96), "[Expression of OVCA1, a candidate tumor suppressor, is reduced in tumors and inhibits growth of ovarian cancer cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10519411)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 0.93), and "[Role of OVCA1/DPH1 in craniofacial abnormalities of Miller-Dieker syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24895408)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 0.9). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 5 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 3 experiments, [POU5F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5460) with 3 experiments, [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 3 experiments, and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 3 experiments.





The gene DPH1 has been associated with [Body mass index (MTAG)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36376304) through genome-wide association studies. The closest MeSH match for this trait is [Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020481), identified using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.071 (80.11th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 2.25 at pH 7.0 (58.48th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.997 (26.28th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 32.0% helix (49.94th percentile), 34.7% sheet (56.79th percentile), and 27.4% turn (41.77th percentile). The instability index is 44.95 (39.0th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.00 (58.8th percentile). The protein has a length of 438 amino acids (50.46th percentile) and a molecular weight of 48133.92 Da (49.61st percentile).
