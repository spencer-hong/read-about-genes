The gene is involved in [mRNA splicing, via spliceosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000398) and [biological_process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008150). It enables [nucleic acid binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003676) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). The gene is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634) and [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), and is part of the [U4/U6 x U5 tri-snRNP complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046540).


The gene length is 53,397 base pairs (68.2% of all genes), the mature length is 4,466 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 52,886 base pairs.


The gene SNRNP27, with NCBI ID 11017, has been mentioned in [2 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SNRNP27%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1986, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1988 and 1994.


The top publications mentioning SNRNP27 include "[The [U4/U6.U5] tri-snRNP-specific 27K protein is a novel SR protein that can be phosphorylated by the snRNP-associated protein kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9085842)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 0.64) and "[Biosynthesis of a novel thyroxine-binding protein (27K protein) in human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3009158)" (1986) (relative citation ratio: 0.4). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SNRNP27](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000124380-SNRNP27) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood expression related to cell proliferation, Cluster 3 for tissue expression with unknown function, Cluster 31 for brain expression related to transcription, Cluster 26 for cell line expression related to mitochondria and RNA binding, and Cluster 39 for single cell expression related to basic cellular processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments, followed by [AHR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/196), [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), each with 3 experiments.





The gene is expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types, including muscle, pineal gland at night, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD19+ B cells (negatively selected), pituitary gland, appendix, superior cervical ganglion, and trigeminal ganglion.



The mouse ortholog gene 66618, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 11017, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal esophagus morphology and hyperactivity, both observed in both sexes. Additionally, the gene is linked to embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis and prior to the tooth bud stage, although these effects are not observed in both sexes. Furthermore, the gene is associated with preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, affecting both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -2.0006 (0.04 percentile), indicating a high hydrophilicity. It exhibits a charge of 28.71 at pH 7.0 (96.86 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.027 (98.95 percentile). The protein has a length of 155 amino acids (8.71 percentile) and a molecular weight of 18859.96 Da (10.34 percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 29.03% for helix (23.8 percentile), 16.13% for sheet (0.81 percentile), and 29.03% for turn (56.14 percentile). The instability index is 143.44 (99.99 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 11.62 (99.71 percentile).
