Furthermore, associations with bone and musculoskeletal system diseases, including hyperostosis and Paget's disease of bone, are also noted.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including skin, as well as in specific cell types such as Lymphoma Burkitt's (Raji) and Leukemia chronic myelogenous K-562. Additionally, the gene shows expression in multiple testis-related tissues, including the interstitial region, Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and germ cells.


The input data highlights various biological processes and pathways, including enhanced WNT signaling and proliferation in RNF mutants, TCF-dependent signaling in response to WNT, and the stabilization of AXIN by XAV939 through tankyrase inhibition. Additionally, misspliced LRP5 mutants exhibit enhanced beta-catenin-dependent signaling. The data also covers signaling by WNT in cancer and general WNT signaling, as well as various stages of the cell cycle, such as the mitotic phase and prometaphase. Other notable pathways include axon guidance, developmental biology, L1CAM interactions, signal transduction by L1, and WNT-mediated activation of DVL.


The mouse ortholog gene 13000 and its human ortholog gene 1459 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal skin and spleen morphology, enlarged spleen, increased circulating alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased vertical activity. Additionally, males specifically show abnormal testis morphology, male infertility, and small testis.
