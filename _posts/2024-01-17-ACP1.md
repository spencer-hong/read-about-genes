The gene enables [acid phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003993) and [protein tyrosine phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004725), including [non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004726), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), specifically in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829) and on the [cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009898). Additionally, it is found in the [sarcolemma](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042383) and the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062).


The gene length is 105,313 base pairs (82.82 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 2,999 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 102,784 base pairs.


The gene ACP1 (NCBI ID: 52) has been mentioned in [135 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ACP1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning ACP1 was in 1974, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2013.


The top 5 publications mentioning ACP1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The inactivation mechanism of low molecular weight phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase by H2O2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9829991)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 3.78), "[S-glutathionylation of LMW-PTP regulates VEGF-mediated FAK activation and endothelial cell migration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22854047)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 1.66), "[5-Arylidene-2-phenylimino-4-thiazolidinones as PTP1B and LMW-PTP inhibitors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19217304)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 1.59), "[LMW-PTP is a positive regulator of tumor onset and growth.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15021900)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 1.57), and "[Human red cell acid phosphatase (ACP1). The amino acid sequence of the two isozymes Bf and Bs encoded by the ACP1*B allele.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1939112)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 1.46). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ACP1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000143727-ACP1) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase and protein phosphatase molecular functions. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with the protein localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. ACP1 is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood (non-specific - cell proliferation), Cluster 68 for tissue (non-specific - protein processing), Cluster 23 for brain (choroid plexus - mixed function), Cluster 26 for cell line (non-specific - mitochondria & RNA binding), and Cluster 11 for single cell (late spermatids - unknown function).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667) with 6 experiments, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) and [SUPT5H](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) each with 5 experiments, and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970) and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) each with 4 experiments.




ACP1 has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083408), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Lipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008074) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, ACP1 is associated with [Large artery stroke](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28265093), corresponding to the MeSH term [Stroke](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020521). Furthermore, it has been implicated in [Low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28240269), which aligns with the MeSH term [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506). Another association includes [Plateletcrit](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), mapping to the MeSH term [Blood Platelets](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001792). These findings highlight the diverse roles of ACP1 in various biological processes and disease conditions.
