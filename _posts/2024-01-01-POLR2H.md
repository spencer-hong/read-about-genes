The gene length is 387 base pairs (0.25 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 387 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 387 base pairs.


The gene POLR2H, with NCBI ID 5437, has been featured in [6 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22POLR2H%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1999, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2002 and 2012.


The top 5 publications mentioning POLR2H, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), which measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, are as follows. The most influential publication is "[Determination of organochlorine pesticide residues in honey, applying solid phase extraction with RP-C18 material.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10605876)" (1999) with a relative citation ratio of 1.25. This is followed by "[Determination of pterins in urine by HPLC with UV and fluorescent detection using different types of chromatographic stationary phases (HILIC, RP C8, RP C18).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24412699)" (2014) with a relative citation ratio of 1.22. Other notable publications include "[BRCA1 ubiquitinates RPB8 in response to DNA damage.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17283126)" (2007) with a relative citation ratio of 0.56, "[Partners of Rpb8p, a small subunit shared by yeast RNA polymerases I, II and III.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11486042)" (2001) with a relative citation ratio of 0.44, and "[Structural, biochemical, and dynamic characterizations of the hRPB8 subunit of human RNA polymerases.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16632472)" (2006) with a relative citation ratio of 0.25.

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [KDM6A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7403), [TAL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6886), [TCF12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6938), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 245841, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 5437, is associated with several phenotypic effects. These include decreased circulating iron levels and increased circulating free fatty acids levels, both observed in both sexes. Additionally, the gene is linked to embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis and prior to the tooth bud stage, although these effects are not observed in both sexes. Furthermore, the gene is associated with complete penetrance preweaning lethality in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.336 (53.7th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -12.301 (18.95th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.002 (52.2nd percentile). The protein has a predicted secondary structure with 32% helix (50.31st percentile), 38% sheet (78.49th percentile), and 30.67% turn (68.52nd percentile) affinities. The instability index is 31.36 (5.22nd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 4.495 (1.49th percentile). The protein is 150 amino acids long (8.06th percentile) with a molecular weight of 17143.1 Da (8.46th percentile).
