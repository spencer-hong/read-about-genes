The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [microtubule binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008017). It is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [centrosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005813), [centriole](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005814), [spindle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005819), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and [cell projection](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042995). Additionally, it is involved in [microtubule anchoring](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0034453), [protein localization to centrosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071539), and [non-motile cilium assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1905515).


The gene length is 2,694 base pairs (7.34% of all genes), the mature length is 985 base pairs (21.97% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 2,694 base pairs (9.44% of all genes).


CEP350 has been mentioned in [9 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CEP350%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 2005, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2007 to 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning CEP350, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[CEP78 functions downstream of CEP350 to control biogenesis of primary cilia by negatively regulating CP110 levels.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34259627)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 2.03), "[A complex of two centrosomal proteins, CAP350 and FOP, cooperates with EB1 in microtubule anchoring.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16314388)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 2.02), "[CEP19 cooperates with FOP and CEP350 to drive early steps in the ciliogenesis programme.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28659385)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.09), "[Centrosomal CAP350 protein stabilises microtubules associated with the Golgi complex.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17878239)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 0.84), and "[Alpha-catenin-dependent recruitment of the centrosomal protein CAP350 to adherens junctions allows epithelial cells to acquire a columnar shape.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25764135)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 0.48). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CEP350](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000135837-CEP350) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, centrosome, basal body, and end piece. The gene is part of Cluster 30 in blood expression, associated with non-specific DNA binding, and Cluster 72 in tissue expression, linked to testis and skeletal muscle protein ubiquitination. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 13, associated with oligodendrocytes and mixed functions. Additionally, CEP350 is found in Cluster 45 in cell line expression, related to nuclear processes, and Cluster 11 in single-cell expression, associated with late spermatids of unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) and [E2F6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1876), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), and [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.


The transcription factor [8861](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861) was found to be regulating genes in 2 experiments according to Perturb-seq data from the study published in [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35688146/).


The input data highlights a diverse range of disease conditions associated with GWAS studies, including various forms of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and malignant mesothelioma. Additionally, respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are noted. Metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, are also prominent. Furthermore, the data encompasses cardiovascular system diseases, cognitive disorders, and diseases of mental health. This comprehensive list underscores the broad applicability of GWAS in understanding the genetic underpinnings of multiple disease categories.


The gene CEP350 has been associated with several traits through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Mean corpuscular hemoglobin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595370), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Erythrocyte Indices](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004909) through a direct synonym match. Additionally, CEP350 is associated with [Smoking initiation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30617275), which aligns with the MeSH term [Smoking](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012907) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method for embedding match.


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including the prefrontal cortex, CD33+ myeloid cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and multiple testis tissues such as interstitial, seminiferous tubule, and germ cells. Additionally, it is expressed in muscle tissue.



The mouse ortholog gene 74081 and its human ortholog 9857 are associated with phenotypes including abnormal coat/hair pigmentation and abnormal vocalization, with these effects observed in both sexes.
