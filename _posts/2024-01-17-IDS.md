The gene enables [iduronate-2-sulfatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004423) and is involved in [calcium ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005509) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and located in the [lysosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005764) and [lysosomal lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043202). Additionally, it is involved in the [glycosaminoglycan catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006027), [heparan sulfate proteoglycan catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030200), and [dermatan sulfate catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030209).


The gene length is 158,471.0 base pairs (89.71% of all genes), the mature length is 1,279.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 152,057.0 base pairs.


The gene IDS (NCBI ID: 3423) has been mentioned in [314 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22IDS%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1968, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning IDS, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology (IDS): preliminary findings.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3737788)" (1986) (relative citation ratio: 26.15), "[A phase II/III clinical study of enzyme replacement therapy with idursulfase in mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter syndrome).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16912578)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 11.28), "[A Phase 2/3 Trial of Pabinafusp Alfa, IDS Fused with Anti-Human Transferrin Receptor Antibody, Targeting Neurodegeneration in MPS-II.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33038326)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 9.09), "[Bed sharing when parents do not smoke: is there a risk of SIDS? An individual level analysis of five major case-control studies.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793691)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 7.65), and "[Iduronate-2-Sulfatase with Anti-human Transferrin Receptor Antibody for Neuropathic Mucopolysaccharidosis II: A Phase 1/2 Trial.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30595526)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 6.14). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[IDS](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000010404-IDS) is a hydrolase with evidence at the protein level, implicated in mucopolysaccharidosis. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is notably expressed in neurons within the brain, contributing to neuronal signaling. Additionally, it is expressed in neutrophils, squamous epithelial cells, NK-cells, and T-cells, playing roles in protein binding, keratinization, and immune system functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), and [RNF2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6045) were each found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various conditions, including cognitive disorders and diseases of mental health.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including blood vessel, brain, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Prefrontal Cortex, Whole Blood, Amygdala, Whole Brain, Caudate Nucleus, and Occipital Lobe.


The input data includes various pathways and diseases related to carbohydrate metabolism, glycosaminoglycan metabolism, and diseases of glycosylation. Notable conditions include Myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora, Glycogen storage diseases, and several types of Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), such as MPS VII - Sly syndrome, MPS VI - Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, and MPS II - Hunter syndrome. Additionally, the data highlights defects in specific genes like B3GAT3, B4GALT1, and CHST14, which are associated with conditions such as JDSSDHD, B4GALT1-CDG (CDG-2d), and EDS, musculocontractural type, respectively. The data also covers diseases related to heparan sulfate/heparin (HS-GAG) metabolism, chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate metabolism, and their degradation pathways.
