The gene enables [virus receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001618) and [signaling receptor binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005102), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is located in the [uropod](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001931), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and [plasma membrane raft](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0044853). The gene plays roles in various biological processes, including [cell adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007155), [symbiont entry into host cell](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046718), [leukocyte migration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050900), [leukocyte tethering or rolling](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050901), [leukocyte adhesive activation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050902), and acts upstream of or within the [cellular response to interleukin-6](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071354).


The gene length is 7,181 base pairs (19.45th percentile), the mature length is 978 base pairs (21.72nd percentile), and the primary transcript length is 2,820 base pairs (10.01st percentile).


The gene SELPLG, with NCBI ID 6404, has been mentioned in [304 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SELPLG%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1969, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2001 and 2014.


The top 5 publications mentioning SELPLG, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 mediates rolling of human neutrophils on P-selectin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7532174)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 13.12), "[Insights into the molecular basis of leukocyte tethering and rolling revealed by structures of P- and E-selectin bound to SLe(X) and PSGL-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11081633)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 11.0), "[Perspectives series: cell adhesion in vascular biology. Role of PSGL-1 binding to selectins in leukocyte recruitment.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9239393)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 10.67), "[Human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 is a functional receptor for enterovirus 71.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19543284)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 8.07), and "[Cutaneous lymphocyte antigen is a specialized form of PSGL-1 expressed on skin-homing T cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9353122)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 7.88). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[SELPLG](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110876-SELPLG) functions as a host cell receptor for virus entry and is detected in many tissues at the RNA level. The protein is localized in vesicles and is involved in immune response processes, as indicated by its expression in various immune-related clusters such as neutrophils, lymphoid tissue, macrophages, microglia, and NK-cells. Evidence for SELPLG's function is supported at the protein level.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 4 experiments, [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 3 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 3 experiments, [IRF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3659) with 3 experiments, and [STAT5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6777) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including mental health disorders. Specifically, the findings highlight links to developmental disorders of mental health, specific developmental disorders, and conduct disorders.


The genome-wide association study identified a significant association between SELPLG and [P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36349687), which was mapped to the closest MeSH term [Glycoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006023) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung, blood, and spleen. Additionally, it is expressed in various immune cell types such as CD33+ myeloid cells, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD14+ monocytes, as well as in whole blood.


The proteins are involved in cell surface interactions at the vascular wall and hemostasis.
