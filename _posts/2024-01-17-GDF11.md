[GDF11](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000135414-GDF11) is a cytokine and growth factor with evidence at the protein level, implicated in disease variants. It is detected in all tissues and localizes to the Golgi apparatus and vesicles. GDF11 is part of Cluster 3 for blood expression, indicating involvement in non-specific nuclear processes, and Cluster 17 for tissue expression, suggesting a role in neuronal synaptic function. In the brain, it is associated with Cluster 46, indicating mixed functions in the brainstem. Additionally, GDF11 is expressed in HMC-1 cell lines, involved in the innate immune response, and in bipolar cells related to visual perception.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the retina, superior cervical ganglion, dorsal root ganglion, globus pallidus, and ovary. Additionally, it is expressed in the brain.



The mouse ortholog gene 14561 and its human ortholog 10220 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities, including abnormal craniofacial morphology, abnormal facial morphology, abnormal tail morphology, cleft palate, and complete penetrance preweaning lethality. These phenotypes are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.287 (59.4% percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 3.57 (62.99% percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.001 (45.97% percentile). The protein has a high instability index of 59.77 (82.67% percentile) and an isoelectric point of 8.18 (60.95% percentile). The sequence length is 407 amino acids (46.29% percentile) with a molecular weight of 45090.29 Da (45.82% percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 32.19% for helix (52.05% percentile), 31.45% for sheet (36.42% percentile), and 28.50% for turn (51.73% percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
