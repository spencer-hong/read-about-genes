The gene length is 5,138 base pairs (14.38% of all genes), the mature length is 1,059 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 4,809 base pairs (17.93% of all genes).


The gene GCC2, with NCBI ID 9648, has been featured in [14 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GCC2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 2003, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning GCC2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Rab and Arl GTPase family members cooperate in the localization of the golgin GCC185.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18243103)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 2.52), "[The trans-Golgi network golgin, GCC185, is required for endosome-to-Golgi transport and maintenance of Golgi structure.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17488291)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 2.16), "[A functional role for the GCC185 golgin in mannose 6-phosphate receptor recycling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16885419)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 1.78), "[GRIP domain-mediated targeting of two new coiled-coil proteins, GCC88 and GCC185, to subcompartments of the trans-Golgi network.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12446665)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 1.72), and "[Multiple Rab GTPase binding sites in GCC185 suggest a model for vesicle tethering at the trans-Golgi.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18946081)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 1.54). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609) with 6 experiments, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 5 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments, [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 5 experiments, and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [6829](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) and [9968](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968). These TFs were found to regulate gene expression in 3 and 1 Perturb-seq experiments, respectively.








The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.899 (7.42nd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -83.012 (0.77th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.019 (96.24th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (48.22%, 99.48th percentile), with lower affinities for sheet (30.82%, 32.73rd percentile) and turn (18.94%, 1.51st percentile) structures. The instability index is 56.59 (76.11th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.10 (9.64th percentile). The protein is 1684 amino acids long (96.12th percentile) with a molecular weight of 195907.33 Da (96.54th percentile).
