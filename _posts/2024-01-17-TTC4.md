The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is active in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634), where it is also located. Additionally, it is found in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654) and [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737). The gene is involved in [protein folding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006457), the [innate immune response](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045087), and the [defense response to virus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051607). Furthermore, it enables [Hsp70 protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030544) and [Hsp90 protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051879).


The gene length is 89,798 base pairs (79.8% of all genes), the mature length is 10,992 base pairs (99.29% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 89,308 base pairs (86.7% of all genes).


The gene TTC4 (NCBI ID: 7268) has been mentioned in [6 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TTC4%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 2000, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2000 to 2006.


The top 5 publications mentioning TTC4, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include "[The human TPR protein TTC4 is a putative Hsp90 co-chaperone which interacts with CDC6 and shows alterations in transformed cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18320024)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 0.47), "[Quantitative Proteomics Identified TTC4 as a TBK1 Interactor and a Positive Regulator of SeV-Induced Innate Immunity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29251827)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.39), "[TTC4, a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene at 1p31 is often mutated in malignant melanoma of the skin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11126369)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 0.22), "[Lack of TTC4 mutations in melanoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12164943)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 0.11), and "[Genomic structure of the human tetratricopeptide repeat-containing gene, TTC4, from chromosome region 1p31 and mutation analysis in breast cancers.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10639601)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 0.09). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TTC4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000243725-TTC4) is a gene with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in skeletal muscle related to muscle contraction and in white matter associated with myelination. Subcellularly, TTC4 is localized to intermediate filaments and cytoplasmic bodies. In blood, it is part of a non-specific cell proliferation cluster, while in cell lines, it is involved in mRNA processing. Single-cell expression data suggests its role in transcription. However, TTC4 is unprognostic for various cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [HDAC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8841) was found to be regulating in 3 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including male reproductive organ cancer, reproductive organ cancer, prostate cancer, cancer, disease of cellular proliferation, organ system cancer, disease of metabolism, acquired metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism disease, glucose metabolism disease, diabetes mellitus, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle and skin. Additionally, it is expressed in several immune cell types such as B lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells, as well as in lymphoma (Burkitt's) and pituitary tissue.



The mouse ortholog gene 72354 and its human ortholog gene 7268 are associated with the phenotypes of limb grasping and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, both of which are observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.672 (19.5th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -10.8 (21.33rd percentile).
