[ADCY3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000138031-ADCY3) is a gene with molecular functions including calmodulin-binding and lyase activity. It is involved in obesity and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is localized in various subcellular locations such as the nucleoplasm, nucleoli, plasma membrane, primary cilium, primary cilium transition zone, and basal body. ADCY3 is expressed in connective tissue, involved in ECM organization, and is found in neurons with mixed functions in the brain. In single cells, it is expressed in smooth muscle cells involved in signal transduction.
