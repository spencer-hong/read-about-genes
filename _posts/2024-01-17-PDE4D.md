[PDE4D](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000113448-PDE4D) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase molecular function, involved in disease variants and is an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence for this gene is established at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized in various subcellular compartments including the nucleoplasm, nuclear membrane, plasma membrane, primary cilium, and cytosol. It is expressed in eosinophils (Cluster 22) and shows non-specific tissue expression (Cluster 56). In the brain, it is associated with astrocytes (Cluster 40), and in cell lines, it is linked to liver cancer metabolism (Cluster 7). Single-cell expression data indicates its involvement in neuronal signaling (Cluster 34).
