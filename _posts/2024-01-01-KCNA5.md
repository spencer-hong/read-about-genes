The gene length is 490 base pairs (0.43 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 399 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 490 base pairs.


The gene KCNA5 (NCBI ID: 3741) has been the subject of [235 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22KCNA5%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1989, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2014.


The top five publications mentioning KCNA5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Cytochrome P-450 hPCN3, a novel cytochrome P-450 IIIA gene product that is differentially expressed in adult human liver. cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence and distinct specificities of cDNA-expressed hPCN1 and hPCN3 for the metabolism of steroid hormones and cyclosporine.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2732228)" (1989) (relative citation ratio: 19.14), "[Sustained depolarization-induced outward current in human atrial myocytes. Evidence for a novel delayed rectifier K+ current similar to Kv1.5 cloned channel currents.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8222078)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 12.92), "[Outward K+ current densities and Kv1.5 expression are reduced in chronic human atrial fibrillation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9168779)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 10.75), "[Mitochondrial metabolism, redox signaling, and fusion: a mitochondria-ROS-HIF-1alpha-Kv1.5 O2-sensing pathway at the intersection of pulmonary hypertension and cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18083891)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 6.93), and "[Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against Kv1.5 mRNA specifically inhibit ultrarapid delayed rectifier K+ current in cultured adult human atrial myocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9118489)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 5.7). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [KCNH2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000157764-KCNH2) functions as an ion channel, specifically a voltage-gated potassium channel. It is implicated in atrial fibrillation and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence supporting its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in Cluster 44 of blood cells, specifically in plasmacytoid DCs, where it is associated with plasma membrane proteins. In tissue expression, it is found in Cluster 60, related to the choroid plexus and transmembrane transport. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 36, also associated with the choroid plexus and mixed functions. Additionally, it is expressed in Cluster 6 of cell lines, linked to leukemia and signal transduction, and in Cluster 25 of single cells, associated with bipolar cells and visual perception.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 5 experiments, [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) with 4 experiments, and [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), each with 3 experiments.








The mouse ortholog gene 16493 and its human ortholog gene 3741 are associated with abnormal skin morphology and thick skin phenotypes, with these effects observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.171 (72.06th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -8.69 (24.95th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.002 (52.81st percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 28.87% helix (22.72nd percentile), 35.07% sheet (59.69th percentile), and 31.48% turn (73.73rd percentile). The instability index is 53.04 (66.74th percentile), suggesting the protein may be unstable. The isoelectric point is 5.68 (22.43rd percentile), with a molecular weight of 67226.99 Da (68.66th percentile). The sequence length is 613 amino acids (69.5th percentile).
