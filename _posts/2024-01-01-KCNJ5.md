The gene length is 518,278 base pairs (98.49% of all genes), the mature length is 11,683 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 517,733 base pairs (99.32% of all genes).


The gene KCNJ5 (NCBI ID: 3762) has been the subject of [111 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22KCNJ5%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1995, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2019.


The top five publications mentioning KCNJ5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Prevalence, clinical, and molecular correlates of KCNJ5 mutations in primary aldosteronism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22275527)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 7.13), "[A Meta-Analysis of Somatic KCNJ5 K(+) Channel Mutations In 1636 Patients With an Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26066531)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 5.76), "[Molecular basis of downregulation of G-protein-coupled inward rectifying K(+) current (I(K,ACh) in chronic human atrial fibrillation: decrease in GIRK4 mRNA correlates with reduced I(K,ACh) and muscarinic receptor-mediated shortening of action potentials.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11714649)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 5.3), "[Expression and mutations of KCNJ5 mRNA in Japanese patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22278422)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 5.01), and "[Microarray, qPCR, and KCNJ5 sequencing of aldosterone-producing adenomas reveal differences in genotype and phenotype between zona glomerulosa- and zona fasciculata-like tumors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22442279)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 4.98). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


The gene [KCNQ1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100988-KCNQ1) functions as an ion channel and voltage-gated channel. It is implicated in cancer-related genes and is a disease variant associated with Long QT syndrome. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. RNA expression is detected in many tissues, with notable expression in the adrenal gland related to steroid metabolism (Cluster 26). In the brain, it shows non-specific mixed function expression (Cluster 44). The gene is also expressed in the DU4475 cell line (Cluster 70) and in basal prostatic cells involved in lipid metabolism (Cluster 3).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The KCNJ5 gene has been associated with [Heart rate variability (corrected root mean square of successive differences)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37803156) and [Heart rate variability (root mean square of successive differences)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37803156) through genome-wide association studies. These associations highlight the potential role of KCNJ5 in cardiovascular regulation and autonomic function.





The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.202 (68.94th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -12.8 (18.23rd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.997 (29.05th percentile). The protein has a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 32.0% (50.06th percentile), 38.4% (80.67th percentile), and 25.5% (25.43rd percentile), respectively.
