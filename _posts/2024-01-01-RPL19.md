The gene length is 368,657 base pairs (96.94th percentile), the mature length is 4,752 base pairs (89.04th percentile), and the primary transcript length is 365,368 base pairs (98.55th percentile).


The gene RPL19, with NCBI ID 6143, has been featured in [21 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RPL19%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1990, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1995 and 2011.


The top 5 publications mentioning RPL19, ranked by their relative citation ratio (RCR), include studies that explore the therapeutic potential of the immunocytokine L19-IL2 in various cancer types. The RCR values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[The tumour-targeting human L19-IL2 immunocytokine: preclinical safety studies, phase I clinical trial in patients with solid tumours and expansion into patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20797845)" (2010) with an RCR of 3.01. Other notable studies include "[A dose-escalation and signal-generating study of the immunocytokine L19-IL2 in combination with dacarbazine for the therapy of patients with metastatic melanoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22028492)" (2011) with an RCR of 2.83, and "[Complete eradication of human B-cell lymphoma xenografts using rituximab in combination with the immunocytokine L19-IL2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19005180)" (2009) with an RCR of 2.5. Additionally, "[High-level expression of the ribosomal protein L19 in human breast tumors that overexpress erbB-2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8095182)" (1993) has an RCR of 2.15, and "[The immunocytokine L19-IL2: An interplay between radiotherapy and long-lasting systemic anti-tumour immune responses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29632732)" (2018) has an RCR of 1.35.

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [SP1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6667), [NIPBL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25836), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), and [CREB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1385), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.


Based on the data from GTRD's database of transcription factor (TF) binding sites and filtered Perturb-seq data, several TFs were identified as significant regulators in multiple experiments. Notably, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623) was found to regulate genes in 5 experiments, followed by [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) and [KLF4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861), each shown to regulate genes in 3 experiments. Additionally, [STAT2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6830), [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872), [BCL6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968), [IRF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9188), and [ZNF592](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57634) were found to regulate genes in 2, 2, 2, 2, and 1 experiments, respectively.








The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -1.111 (2.58th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 44.01 at pH 7.0 (98.94th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.011 (83.58th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be predominantly helical, with 44.39% of amino acids in helix form (98th percentile), 26.53% in sheet form (12.72nd percentile), and 16.33% in turn form (0.39th percentile). The instability index is 60.95 (84.73rd percentile), and the isoelectric point is 11.48 (99.62nd percentile). The protein has a length of 196 amino acids (13.88th percentile) and a molecular weight of 23465.71 Da (15.98th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
