The gene length is 20,983 base pairs (43.2% of all genes), the mature length is 662 base pairs (7.83% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 11,259 base pairs (36.42% of all genes).


The gene STK25 (NCBI ID: 10494) has been mentioned in [35 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22STK25%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1997 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2012 and 2022. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning STK25, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[YSK1 is activated by the Golgi matrix protein GM130 and plays a role in cell migration through its substrate 14-3-3zeta.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15037601)" (2004) with a relative citation ratio of 3.61, "[MO25 is a master regulator of SPAK/OSR1 and MST3/MST4/YSK1 protein kinases.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21423148)" (2011) with a relative citation ratio of 2.7, "[Reelin and stk25 have opposing roles in neuronal polarization and dendritic Golgi deployment.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21111240)" (2010) with a relative citation ratio of 2.57, "[Protein kinase STK25 regulates hepatic lipid partitioning and progression of liver steatosis and NASH.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25609431)" (2015) with a relative citation ratio of 1.92, and "[STK25 suppresses Hippo signaling by regulating SAV1-STRIPAK antagonism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32292165)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 1.82. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[STK25](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000115694-STK25) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase with transferase activity, functioning as a kinase. Evidence for this gene is available at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in skeletal muscle related to striated muscle contraction, neurons with mixed functions, and various cell lines associated with mitochondria and RNA binding. In blood, STK25 is involved in cell proliferation processes. Single-cell expression data indicate its role in basic cellular processes.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), [KLF5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/688), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624), and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, thyroid, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Thyroid, CD105+ Endothelial cells, CD71+ Early Erythroid cells, Amygdala, Whole brain, Lung, and Leukemia lymphoblastic (MOLT-4) cells.
