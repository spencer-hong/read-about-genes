The gene enables [water transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005372) and [urea transmembrane transporter activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015204), as well as [urea channel activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015265). It is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and the [basolateral plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016323). The gene is involved in several processes, including [water transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006833), [urea transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015840), [establishment of localization in cell](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051649), [transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0055085), and [urea transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071918).


The gene length is 4,973 base pairs (13.89% of all genes), with a mature length of 4,973 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 4,973 base pairs.


The gene SLC14A1 (NCBI ID: 6563) has been mentioned in [56 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLC14A1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1956 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1994 and 2015. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning SLC14A1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Kidd blood group and urea transport function of human erythrocytes are carried by the same protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7797558)" (1995) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 3.49, "[Characterization of the gene encoding the human Kidd blood group/urea transporter protein. Evidence for splice site mutations in Jknull individuals.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9582331)" (1998) with an RCR of 3.2, "[European genome-wide association study identifies SLC14A1 as a new urinary bladder cancer susceptibility gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21750109)" (2011) with an RCR of 2.9, "[A genome-wide association study of bladder cancer identifies a new susceptibility locus within SLC14A1, a urea transporter gene on chromosome 18q12.3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21824976)" (2011) with an RCR of 2.12, and "[Close genetic linkage between diabetes mellitus and kidd blood group.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6117683)" (1981) with an RCR of 1.82. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[SLC14A1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000141469-SLC14A1) functions as a blood group antigen and is primarily located in the plasma membrane. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 9 in T-regs for blood expression, Cluster 9 in oligodendrocytes for tissue expression, Cluster 44 in the brain, Cluster 72 in neuronal cell lines, and Cluster 41 in adipocytes and endothelial cells at the single-cell level.

The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as organ system cancer and urinary bladder cancer. Additionally, the data highlights metabolic disorders, specifically diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Cardiovascular issues, including artery disease, vascular disease, and hypertension, are also implicated. Furthermore, the data points to kidney disease and urinary system disease, underscoring a broad spectrum of health conditions linked to the genetic variants studied.


The gene SLC14A1 has been associated with [Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888493) through genome-wide association studies. The closest MeSH match for this trait is [Hemoglobins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006454), identified using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the bladder, prostate, and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles.
