The top 5 publications mentioning LPAR6, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that have significantly contributed to the understanding of this gene's role in various biological contexts. The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable publications include "[Disruption of P2RY5, an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, underlies autosomal recessive woolly hair.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18297072)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 3.57), "[Structural insights into ligand recognition by the lysophosphatidic acid receptor LPA<sub>6</sub>.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28792932)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 3.3), "[Lysophosphatidic acid receptor LPAR6 supports the tumorigenicity of hepatocellular carcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25589345)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.66), "[Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling via LPA<sub>4</sub> and LPA<sub>6</sub> negatively regulates cell motile activities of colon cancer cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27993681)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.61), and "[Diverse effects of LPA4, LPA5 and LPA6 on the activation of tumor progression in pancreatic cancer cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25849892)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.61).

[LPAR6](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000139679-LPAR6) is a G-protein coupled receptor with transducer and receptor functions. It is implicated in hypotrichosis and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues and is localized in vesicles and the plasma membrane. LPAR6 is expressed in epithelium and extracellular exosomes, with notable expression in macrophages and microglia in the brain, and in leukemia cell lines. It is also expressed in dendritic cells, where it is involved in antigen presentation.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 4 experiments. Additionally, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [STAT5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6777) were found to be regulating in 3 experiments each.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and cardiovascular system disease. Additionally, broader categories such as disease and disease of anatomical entity are also implicated.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the vagina, salivary gland, and prostate. Additionally, it is expressed in several immune cell types such as CD33+ myeloid cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD14+ monocytes, as well as in whole blood, salivary gland, leukemia lymphoblastic cells (MOLT-4), and lymph nodes.


The input data includes various pathways and processes involving G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as rhodopsin-like receptors, GPCR ligand binding, and downstream signaling events. Specific pathways highlighted include G alpha (q) signaling, the gastrin-CREB pathway via PKC and MAPK, and signaling by GPCRs in general. Additionally, the data mentions nucleotide-like (purinergic) receptors, specifically P2Y receptors. Disease-related pathways include those associated with defective ACTH causing obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (POMCD), as well as metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.528, indicating a high level of hydrophobicity (95.52% percentile). It exhibits a charge of 14.79 at pH 7.0 (88.85% percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.979 (3.86% percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be predominantly in sheet form, with a sheet affinity of 0.503 (98.68% percentile), while helix and turn affinities are 0.238 (3.32% percentile) and 0.233 (11.09% percentile), respectively. The instability index is 37.56 (15.49% percentile), and the isoelectric point is 9.22 (84.94% percentile). The protein has a length of 344 amino acids (36.98% percentile) and a molecular weight of 39391.17 Da (38.63% percentile).
