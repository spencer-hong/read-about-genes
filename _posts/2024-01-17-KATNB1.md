The gene KATNB1 (NCBI ID: 10300) has been mentioned in [9 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22KATNB1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 2000 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2011 and 2016. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning KATNB1 include "[Mutations in KATNB1 cause complex cerebral malformations by disrupting asymmetrically dividing neural progenitors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25521378)" (2014) (relative citation ratio: 2.23), "[Two domains of p80 katanin regulate microtubule severing and spindle pole targeting by p60 katanin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10751153)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 1.9), "[A role for antibodies to human leukocyte antigens, collagen-V, and K-Î±1-Tubulin in antibody-mediated rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21383658)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 1.3), "[LAPSER1 is a putative cytokinetic tumor suppressor that shows the same centrosome and midbody subcellular localization pattern as p80 katanin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17351128)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 0.61), and "[KATNB1 is a master regulator of multiple katanin enzymes in male meiosis and haploid germ cell development.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34822718)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.57). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[KATNB1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000140854-KATNB1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, implicated in the disease variant Lissencephaly. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the plasma membrane, microtubules, and cytosol. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 25 for blood with unknown function, Cluster 5 for tissue in brain and testis related to signal transduction, Cluster 53 for brain in neurons with mixed function, Cluster 68 for cell lines related to cell cycle regulation, and Cluster 42 for single cells in ciliated cells involved in cilium assembly.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725) with 5 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments, [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149) with 4 experiments, [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157) with 4 experiments, and [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, cardiovascular system disease, and heart disease.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including skin and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the amygdala, whole brain, lung, leukemia lymphoblastic (MOLT-4), testis, testis interstitial, and testis Leydig cells.



The mouse ortholog gene 74187 and its human ortholog gene 10300 are associated with the phenotype of preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.287 (59.37th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of 1.66 (56.13th percentile).
