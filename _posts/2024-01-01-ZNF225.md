The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) values measure the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [BRD9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/65980), [PEX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5828), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), and [KDM5B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10765), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.991 (4.62nd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 42.36 at pH 7.0 (98.85th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.005 (63.13rd percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 29.04% helix (23.82nd percentile), 26.63% sheet (13.07th percentile), and 24.79% turn (20.04th percentile). The instability index is 41.69 (27.59th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.18 (83.87th percentile). The protein has a length of 706 amino acids (75.64th percentile) and a molecular weight of 82470.68 Da (77.5th percentile).
