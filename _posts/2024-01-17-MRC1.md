The gene enables [virus receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001618), [transmembrane signaling receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004888), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [mannose binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005537). It is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and is active in the same component. Additionally, it is located in the [cell surface](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009986) and the [endosome membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0010008). The gene is involved in [receptor-mediated endocytosis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006898), [symbiont entry into host cell](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046718), [cellular response to lipopolysaccharide](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071222), [cellular response to type II interferon](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071346), and [cellular response to interleukin-4](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0071353). Furthermore, it enables [signaling receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0038023) and [cargo receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0038024).


The gene length is 13,712 base pairs (32.86% of all genes), the mature length is 1,774 base pairs (46.36% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 10,021 base pairs (33.3% of all genes).


The gene MRC1 (NCBI ID: 4360) has been mentioned in [190 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MRC1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1987, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2008 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning MRC1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Dendritic cells use macropinocytosis and the mannose receptor to concentrate macromolecules in the major histocompatibility complex class II compartment: downregulation by cytokines and bacterial products.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7629501)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 43.73), "[Pro-inflammatory CD11c+CD206+ adipose tissue macrophages are associated with insulin resistance in human obesity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20357360)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 10.89), "[The mannose receptor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22966131)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 10.32), "[Mannose receptor (CD206) activation in tumor-associated macrophages enhances adaptive and innate antitumor immune responses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32051227)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 9.47), and "[The mannose receptor mediates dengue virus infection of macrophages.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18266465)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 6.69). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MRC1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000260314-MRC1) functions as a host cell receptor for virus entry and is an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is particularly expressed in lung tissue, where it plays a role in lung function. It is also found in dendritic cells, although its function in these cells is unknown. In the brain, MRC1 is expressed in the choroid plexus, where it has a mixed function. Additionally, the gene is expressed in macrophages, contributing to the innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), each shown to be regulating in 2 experiments.





The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including adipose tissue, lung, and spleen.


The proteins are involved in various immune system pathways, including cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens in endosomes, antigen processing for cross-presentation, and class I MHC-mediated antigen processing and presentation. These processes are integral parts of the adaptive immune system.
