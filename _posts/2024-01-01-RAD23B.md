The gene length is 679.0 base pairs (0.79 percentile of all genes), with a mature length of 679.0 base pairs and a primary transcript length of 679.0 base pairs.


The gene RAD23B, with NCBI ID 5887, has been the subject of [46 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RAD23B%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1996 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2006 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning RAD23B, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that explore the gene's role in various biological processes. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable publications include "[Circular RNA circ-RAD23B promotes cell growth and invasion by miR-593-3p/CCND2 and miR-653-5p/TIAM1 pathways in non-small cell lung cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30722989)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 2.87), "[Isolation of mammalian 26S proteasomes and p97/VCP complexes using the ubiquitin-like domain from HHR23B reveals novel proteasome-associated proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19182904)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 2.63), "[HR23B is a biomarker for tumor sensitivity to HDAC inhibitor-based therapy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20308564)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 2.59), "[HHR23B, a human Rad23 homolog, stimulates XPC protein in nucleotide excision repair in vitro.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8756644)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 2.56), and "[Molecular basis for damage recognition and verification by XPC-RAD23B and TFIIH in nucleotide excision repair.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30174301)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 2.16).
