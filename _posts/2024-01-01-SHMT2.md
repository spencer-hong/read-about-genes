The gene length is 902,101.0 base pairs (99.51% of all genes), the mature length is 7,121.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 586,571.0 base pairs.


The gene SHMT2, with NCBI ID 6472, has been featured in [72 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SHMT2%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 1957, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2002 and 2021.


The top five publications mentioning SHMT2, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[SHMT2 is Associated with Tumor Purity, CD8+ T Immune Cells Infiltration, and a Novel Therapeutic Target in Four Different Human Cancers.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35023455)" (2023) with a relative citation ratio of 8.95. Following this, "[SHMT2 drives glioma cell survival in ischaemia but imposes a dependence on glycine clearance.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25855294)" (2015) has a relative citation ratio of 8.16. Additionally, "[SHMT2 Desuccinylation by SIRT5 Drives Cancer Cell Proliferation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29180469)" (2018) has a relative citation ratio of 5.36. "[Comparative oncogenomics identifies PSMB4 and SHMT2 as potential cancer driver genes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24755469)" (2014) has a relative citation ratio of 3.11. Lastly, "[Purification and properties of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7400147)" (1980) has a relative citation ratio of 2.92. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 6 experiments, followed by [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [NEUROD1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4760), each with 5 experiments.





The gene SHMT2 has been associated with various traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Metabolite peak levels (QI7703)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35995766) and [X-24452 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36357675). These associations highlight the potential role of SHMT2 in metabolic processes and biomarker levels.


The mouse ortholog gene 108037, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 6472, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal embryo size, abnormal placenta size, increased spleen weight, and pallor, all of which are observed in both sexes. Additionally, the gene is linked to prenatal lethality in females and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance in both sexes. Furthermore, a prolonged PR interval is noted, although this is not observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.2734 (61.02 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 6.54 (72.8 percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.996 (25.41 percentile). The protein's secondary structure affinities are 33.93% for helix (67.26 percentile), 33.73% for sheet (50.07 percentile), and 27.18% for turn (39.64 percentile). The instability index is 39.14 (19.82 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.76 (72.79 percentile). The protein is 504 amino acids long (58.74 percentile) with a molecular weight of 55992.32 Da (58.52 percentile).
