The gene length is 1,461 base pairs (3.69 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 518 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 1,461 base pairs.


The gene PAPOLA, with NCBI ID 10914, has been mentioned in [978 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PAPOLA%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication is 1901, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1998 and 2014.


The top five publications mentioning PAPOLA, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Demographic predictors of mammography and Pap smear screening in US women.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8417607)" (1993) with a relative citation ratio of 15.79, "[Background staining and sensitivity of the unlabelled antibody-enzyme (PAP) method. Comparison with the peroxidase labelled antibody sandwich method using formalin fixed paraffin embedded material.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/50308)" (1975) with a relative citation ratio of 14.58, "[Evaluation of the atypical Pap smear.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3631155)" (1987) with a relative citation ratio of 10.54, "[Virologic versus cytologic triage of women with equivocal Pap smears: a meta-analysis of the accuracy to detect high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14970277)" (2004) with a relative citation ratio of 8.37, and "[The Pap test and Bethesda 2014.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25931431)" (2015) with a relative citation ratio of 8.15. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PAPOLA](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000090060-PAPOLA) is a gene with molecular functions in RNA-binding and transferase activity. Evidence for its function is supported at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. In terms of expression, PAPOLA is found in Cluster 35 of blood expression, which is associated with neutrophils and protein binding. It is also part of Cluster 40 in tissue expression, Cluster 55 in brain expression, and Cluster 30 in cell line expression, all of which are non-specific and related to transcription or gene expression regulation. Additionally, PAPOLA is detected in Cluster 27 of single-cell expression, which is associated with syncytiotrophoblasts and pregnancy.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 6 experiments, [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025) with 5 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments, [STAT3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6774) with 5 experiments, and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including disease of anatomical entity, bone inflammation disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bone disease, connective tissue disease, and musculoskeletal system disease.



The gene is expressed in various immune cell types, including B lymphoblasts, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD71+ early erythroid cells. Additionally, it is expressed in the ovary.


The input data highlights various processes involved in gene expression and RNA processing. These include RNA polymerase II transcription, transcription termination, and post-elongation processing of both intron-containing and intronless pre-mRNAs. Specific processes mentioned are mRNA 3'-end processing, mRNA splicing, and the major pathway of mRNA splicing. Additionally, the data covers the cleavage of growing transcripts in the termination region and the processing of capped intronless and intron-containing pre-mRNAs.


The mouse ortholog gene 18789 and its human ortholog gene 10914 are associated with phenotypes including abnormal embryo size and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, affecting both sexes.
