The gene length is 48,768 base pairs (65.63% of all genes), the mature length is 5,900 base pairs (93.83% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 46,938 base pairs (73.85% of all genes).


The gene CXCL12 (NCBI ID: 6387) has been mentioned in [2,085 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CXCL12%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2009 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning CXCL12, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Progenitor cell trafficking is regulated by hypoxic gradients through HIF-1 induction of SDF-1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15235597)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 43.2), "[The lymphocyte chemoattractant SDF-1 is a ligand for LESTR/fusin and blocks HIV-1 entry.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8752280)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 35.66), "[CXCL12 in early mesenchymal progenitors is required for haematopoietic stem-cell maintenance.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23434756)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 26.01), "[The chemokine SDF-1 is a chemoattractant for human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and provides a new mechanism to explain the mobilization of CD34+ progenitors to peripheral blood.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8996247)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 22.33), and "[A novel chemokine receptor for SDF-1 and I-TAC involved in cell survival, cell adhesion, and tumor development.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16940167)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 21.17). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CXCL12](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000107562-CXCL12) is a cytokine and growth factor with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is particularly associated with connective tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, as seen in its tissue expression cluster (Cluster 62). In the brain, it is involved in immune response (Cluster 8), and in cell lines, it is again linked to connective tissue cells and ECM organization (Cluster 44). Single-cell expression analysis places it in fibroblasts involved in ECM organization (Cluster 53).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 5 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) and [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) each with 4 experiments, and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) each with 3 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, nervous system disease, central nervous system disease, heart disease, myocardial infarction, basal ganglia disease, frontotemporal dementia, and brain disease.


The genome-wide association study has identified a significant association between CXCL12 and [White blood cell count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34226706), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Leukocyte Count](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007958) using the method [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, cardiac myocytes, CD105+ endothelial cells, bone marrow, appendix, uterus, and lymph nodes.


The input data highlights various pathways involving proteins, including signaling by ERBB4 and its nuclear signaling, chemokine receptors binding chemokines, and class A/1 (Rhodopsin-like receptors). Additionally, it covers defective ACTH causing obesity and pro-opiomelanocortin deficiency (POMCD), GPCR ligand binding, and metabolic disorders of biological oxidation enzymes. The data also includes peptide ligand-binding receptors, G alpha (i) signaling events, disease-related pathways, GPCR downstream signaling, signaling by GPCR, and general signal transduction.


The mouse ortholog gene 20315, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 6387, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal uterus morphology, enlarged uterus, and hydrometra, all specific to one sex. Additionally, this gene is linked to preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, affecting both sexes.
