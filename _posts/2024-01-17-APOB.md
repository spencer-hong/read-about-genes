[APOB](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000084674-APOB) is a gene with a molecular function in heparin-binding and is involved in atherosclerosis, with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, and it is primarily located in vesicles and the cytosol. The gene is highly expressed in the liver, specifically in hepatocytes, and is associated with metabolism. It is also expressed in astrocytes in the brain and in liver cancer cell lines. While APOB is unprognostic for several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and testicular germ cell tumor, its expression patterns highlight its significant role in metabolic processes.
