The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [actin filament binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051015). It is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [brush border](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005903), [actin cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015629), [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), [cortical cytoskeleton](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030863), and [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). It is also part of the [F-actin capping protein complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008290). The gene is involved in [actin cytoskeleton organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030036), [barbed-end actin filament capping](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051016), and [protein-containing complex assembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0065003).


The gene length is 5,509 base pairs (15.39% of all genes), the mature length is 616 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 5,509 base pairs.


The gene CAPZA2 (NCBI ID: 830) has been mentioned in [17 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CAPZA2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1995 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1997 and 2012. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning CAPZA2, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that explore the gene's role in various biological processes. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable publications include "[BAG3 and Hsc70 interact with actin capping protein CapZ to maintain myofibrillar integrity under mechanical stress.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20884878)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 2.63), "[Inhibition of CapZ during myofibrillogenesis alters assembly of actin filaments.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7822423)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 2.23), and "[Linking the T cell surface protein CD2 to the actin-capping protein CAPZ via CMS and CIN85.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12690097)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 1.5). Additionally, "[F-actin capping (CapZ) and other contractile saphenous vein smooth muscle proteins are altered by hemodynamic stress: a proteonomic approach.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14612593)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 1.17) and "[Randomized phase III trial of gemcitabine and cisplatin vs. gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and a performance status of 2: the CAPPA-2 study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23643177)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.11) are also significant.

[CAPZA2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000198898-CAPZA2) is a gene with molecular functions in actin capping and actin-binding, supported by evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and the protein is primarily located in the cytosol. In terms of expression clusters, CAPZA2 is found in Cluster 28 for blood expression, specifically in neutrophils with unknown function, and in Cluster 56 for tissue expression with non-specific function. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 35, associated with DNA binding. Additionally, CAPZA2 is expressed in Cluster 61 of the BICR 18 cell line, which is related to protein kinases, and in Cluster 37 of single-cell expression, found in glandular and luminal cells with unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [NFYA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4800), [OTX2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5015), [NKX2-1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7080), [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), and [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.




CAPZA2 has been associated with several traits related to blood platelets and pregnancy. Specifically, it has been linked to [high fluorescence immature platelet fraction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596262), [immature platelet count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596262), and [immature platelet fraction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596262), all of which map closely to the MeSH term [Blood Platelets](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001792) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, CAPZA2 is associated with [mean platelet volume during the second trimester of pregnancy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38064665) and [mean platelet volume during the third trimester of pregnancy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38064665), both mapping to the MeSH term [Pregnancy](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011247).


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including adipose tissue and blood vessels. Additionally, it is expressed in CD33+ myeloid cells, thyroid, CD14+ monocytes, whole blood, CD71+ early erythroid cells, colon, and small intestine.


The input data highlights several key pathways involved in immune function and hemostasis. These include the broader immune system, the innate immune system, advanced glycosylation endproduct receptor signaling, factors involved in megakaryocyte development and platelet production, and hemostasis.
