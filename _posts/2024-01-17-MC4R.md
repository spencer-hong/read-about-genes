[MC4R](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000166603-MC4R) is a G-protein coupled receptor involved in transduction processes, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. It is implicated in obesity and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. The gene is detected in some tissues and is notably expressed in neuronal and synaptic function clusters, particularly in the hypothalamus where it plays a role in neuropeptide signaling. Additionally, MC4R is expressed in mucus-secreting cells and bipolar cells involved in visual perception.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) and [HIF1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3091), each shown to be regulating in 3 experiments.

Additionally, associations have been found with [C-reactive protein levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), mapping to the MeSH term [Proteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D011506) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Other traits include [High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484), mapping to [Lipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008074), and [Waist-hip ratio](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239722), which directly matches the MeSH term [Waist-Hip Ratio](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D049629). These findings highlight the multifaceted role of MC4R in various physiological processes.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the esophagus, brain, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the prefrontal cortex, cardiac myocytes, heart, liver, and specific lymphoma cell lines such as Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji and Daudi).
