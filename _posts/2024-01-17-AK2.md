The gene enables [adenylate kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004017) and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524). It is active in the [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737) and [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739), and is located in the [mitochondrial intermembrane space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005758), [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062), and [sperm mitochondrial sheath](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0097226). The gene is involved in various processes, including the [ADP biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006172), [nucleobase-containing small molecule interconversion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015949), [phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016310), [AMP metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046033), [ATP metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046034), and [nucleoside monophosphate phosphorylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046940).


The gene length is 18,529 base pairs (40.24% of all genes), the mature length is 1,100 base pairs (25.94% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 12,188 base pairs (38.55% of all genes).


The gene AK2 (NCBI ID: 204) has been mentioned in [25 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22AK2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning AK2 was in 1963, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning AK2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The world distribution of electrophoretic variants of the red cell enzyme adenylate kinase (ATP:AMP phosphotransferase)EC 2.7.4.3.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5512125)" (1970) (relative citation ratio: 2.19), "[Release of adenylate kinase 2 from the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10218571)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 1.87), "[AK2 activates a novel apoptotic pathway through formation of a complex with FADD and caspase-10.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17952061)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 1.41), "[Circ-AK2 is associated with preeclampsia and regulates biological behaviors of trophoblast cells through miR-454-3p/THBS2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33129036)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.28), and "[Reticular dysgenesis-associated AK2 protects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell development from oxidative stress.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26150473)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.21). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[AK2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000004455-AK2) is a kinase and transferase with evidence at the protein level, implicated in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) as a disease variant. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localized in the mitochondria. AK2 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 29 in blood with unknown function, Cluster 55 in kidney and intestine related to metabolism, Cluster 6 in brain associated with immune response, Cluster 37 in cell lines involved in mRNA processing, and Cluster 56 in single cells specific to proximal tubular cells and amino acid metabolism.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ZFX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7543), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including the thyroid and kidney, as indicated by BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD34+ cells, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, leukemia chronic myelogenous K-562 cells, leukemia promyelocytic HL-60 cells, lymphoma burkitts (Daudi) cells, and the kidney.


The input data highlights key pathways involved in metabolism, specifically focusing on the synthesis and interconversion of nucleotide di- and triphosphates, as well as the broader metabolism of nucleotides.



The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.281 (60.01 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of 0.94 (53.71 percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.007 (72.57 percentile), with a significant portion of amino acids predicted to be in helical structures (38.49%, 90.08 percentile). The instability index is 37.38 (15.05 percentile), and the isoelectric point is 7.67 (56.03 percentile). The protein has a length of 239 amino acids (20.08 percentile) and a molecular weight of 26477.45 Da (19.99 percentile). Secondary structure predictions show 32.22% sheet (40.79 percentile) and 27.62% turn (43.83 percentile) affinities.
