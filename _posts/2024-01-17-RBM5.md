The gene RBM5 (NCBI ID: 10181) has been mentioned in [63 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RBM5%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1953 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2009 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning RBM5, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[RBM5, 6, and 10 differentially regulate NUMB alternative splicing to control cancer cell proliferation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24332178)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 6.02). Other notable publications include "[G-Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor Antagonist G15 Decreases Estrogen-Induced Development of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28877783)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 2.21), "[RBM5 is a male germ cell splicing factor and is required for spermatid differentiation and male fertility.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23935508)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.43), "[G15, a GPR30 antagonist, induces apoptosis and autophagy in human oral squamous carcinoma cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24161432)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.41), and "[Autoregulation of RBM10 and cross-regulation of RBM10/RBM5 via alternative splicing-coupled nonsense-mediated decay.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28586478)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.09).

[RBM5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000003756-RBM5) is an RNA-binding protein with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm, perinuclear theca, flagellar centriole, mid piece, principal piece, and end piece. RBM5 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 35 in neutrophils related to protein binding, Cluster 64 in neuronal tissues related to transcription, Cluster 28 in oligodendrocytes with mixed function, Cluster 8 in non-specific cell lines involved in basic cellular processes, and Cluster 55 in non-specific single cells related to transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 5 experiments, followed by [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [KDM1A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23028), [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), and [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), each with 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including diseases of metabolism, coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and cardiovascular system disease. Additionally, the data highlights links to mental health disorders, substance-related disorders, and specific conditions such as alcohol dependence. Furthermore, inherited metabolic disorders, including lipid storage diseases, lysosomal storage diseases, cholesterol ester storage disease, and cholesterol embolism, are also implicated.


The gene RBM5 has been associated with [Alzheimer's disease or educational attainment (pleiotropy)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34743297) through genome-wide association studies. The closest MeSH match for this trait is [Education](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004493), identified using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method.


The gene is expressed in various tissues and cell types, including the ovary and pituitary gland. Additionally, it is expressed in several immune cell types such as CD34+, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells (negatively selected). Expression is also observed in the fetal brain and lymph nodes.


The proteins are involved in several key processes, including gene expression, processing of capped intron-containing pre-mRNA, and mRNA splicing, with a particular focus on the major pathway of mRNA splicing.
