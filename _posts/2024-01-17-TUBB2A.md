[TUBB2A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000137267-TUBB2A) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, known for its disease variant involvement. It is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in microtubules, cytokinetic bridges, mitotic spindles, primary cilia, basal bodies, flagellar centrioles, principal pieces, and end pieces. The gene is part of Cluster 16 for blood expression, which is non-specific and related to cell proliferation. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 33, associated with brain neuronal signaling. Additionally, TUBB2A is part of Cluster 24 in brain expression, which involves neurons with mixed functions. In cell line expression, it is found in Cluster 69, related to skin cancer and ECM organization, and in single-cell expression, it is part of Cluster 59, involving suprabasal keratinocytes and cornification.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341), and [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including skin and brain. According to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles, the gene is detected in skin and brain samples. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in specific brain regions such as the amygdala, whole brain, fetal brain, and cerebellum.


The input data highlights several pathways involved in protein metabolism and transport. These include the metabolism of proteins, transmembrane transport of small molecules, and orphan transporters. Additionally, the data emphasizes various aspects of protein folding, such as chaperonin-mediated protein folding, general protein folding processes, and specific pathways like the cooperation of prefoldin and TriC/CCT in actin and tubulin folding. It also covers prefoldin-mediated transfer of substrates to CCT/TriC, the formation of tubulin folding intermediates by CCT/TriC, and the post-chaperonin tubulin folding pathway.


The mouse ortholog gene 22151 and its human ortholog gene 7280 are associated with hyperactivity, a phenotype observed in both sexes.
