The gene is part of the [ubiquitin ligase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000151) and is involved in the [MAPK cascade](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000165) and [Ras protein signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007265). It enables [nucleic acid binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003676), [ubiquitin-protein transferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004842), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [nuclear localization sequence binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008139), [zinc ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008270), [identical protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042802), and [ubiquitin protein ligase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0061630). It is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), and [nuclear membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031965). Additionally, it is involved in [negative regulation of signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009968) and [protein ubiquitination](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016567).


The gene length is 78,773 base pairs (77.05% of all genes), the mature length is 4,780 base pairs (89.21% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 78,773 base pairs (84.43% of all genes).


The gene BRAP (NCBI ID: 8315) has been mentioned in [35 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22BRAP%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1989 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2011 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning BRAP, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The let-7-Imp axis regulates ageing of the Drosophila testis stem-cell niche.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22660319)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 2.87), "[PReferentially expressed antigen in MElanoma (PRAME) expression in BRCA1-associated protein (BAP1)-inactivated melanocytic tumors and deep penetrating nevi: A pilot study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094849)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 2.57), "[BRCA1-associated protein (BAP1)-inactivated melanocytic tumors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31233225)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 2.31), "[A phenomics-based strategy identifies loci on APOC1, BRAP, and PLCG1 associated with metabolic syndrome phenotype domains.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22022282)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 1.88), and "[SNPs in BRAP associated with risk of myocardial infarction in Asian populations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19198608)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 1.56). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[BRAP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000089234-BRAP) is a gene encoding a protein with transferase molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is primarily localized in the nuclear membrane and cytosol. BRAP is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 35 in neutrophils related to protein binding, Cluster 4 in testis associated with basic cellular processes, Cluster 28 in oligodendrocytes with mixed function, Cluster 38 in non-specific cell lines related to transcription, and Cluster 70 in spermatocytes and spermatids involved in spermatid development.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [GATA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623), [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126), [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065), [ZBTB7A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51341), and [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as gastrointestinal system cancer, organ system cancer, and esophageal cancer. Additionally, infectious diseases, particularly those caused by viral agents like human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B, are also implicated. Cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, vascular disease, and myocardial infarction, are notable, as well as hypertension and kidney disease. Mental health disorders, such as cognitive disorder, psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, and substance-related disorders including alcohol dependence and abuse, are also represented. This diverse set of associations highlights the complex interplay between genetic factors and a broad spectrum of diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including bladder and skin, according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), whole blood, CD71+ early erythroid cells, testis, testis interstitial cells, testis Leydig cells, and testis seminiferous tubules.



The mouse ortholog gene 72399 and its human ortholog 8315 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. Both sexes exhibit abnormal blood vessel morphology, abnormal lymph node morphology, abnormal neural tube closure and morphology, edema, embryonic growth retardation, enlarged lymph nodes, and hemorrhage. Additionally, there is prenatal lethality prior to heart atrial septation, specifically in males, and complete penetrance preweaning lethality in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.553 (29.67th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -15.1 (15.24th percentile). The median structural flexibility is 1.006 (69.33rd percentile), with a predicted secondary structure composition of 35.5% helix (77.76th percentile), 31.6% sheet (37.17th percentile), and 24.0% turn (14.98th percentile). The instability index is 59.3 (81.67th percentile), suggesting high instability. The isoelectric point is 5.64 (21.56th percentile), with a molecular weight of 67303.9 Da (68.74th percentile). The sequence length is 592 amino acids (67.88th percentile).
