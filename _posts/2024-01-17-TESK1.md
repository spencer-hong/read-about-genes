The gene length is 103,195 base pairs (82.38% of all genes), the mature length is 2,592 base pairs (65.71% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 65,486.5 base pairs (81.15% of all genes).


The gene TESK1 (NCBI ID: 7016) has been mentioned in [8 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22TESK1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning TESK1 was in 1995, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1999 and 2007.


The top 5 publications mentioning TESK1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Identification and characterization of a novel protein kinase, TESK1, specifically expressed in testicular germ cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8537404)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 1.32), "[Human sprouty 4, a new ras antagonist on 5q31, interacts with the dual specificity kinase TESK1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12027893)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 1.25), "[Binding of 14-3-3beta regulates the kinase activity and subcellular localization of testicular protein kinase 1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11555644)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 0.69), "[Actopaxin interacts with TESK1 to regulate cell spreading on fibronectin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15817463)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 0.69), and "[Decreased TESK1-mediated cofilin 1 phosphorylation in the jejunum of IBS-D patients may explain increased female predisposition to epithelial dysfunction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29396473)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 0.58). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[TESK1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000107140-TESK1) is a gene encoding a protein with multiple molecular functions, including kinase, serine/threonine-protein kinase, transferase, and tyrosine-protein kinase. Evidence for this protein is available at the protein level. The RNA expression of TESK1 is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the testis, where it is involved in transcription. In the brain, it is expressed in sub-cortical regions with mixed functions. Additionally, TESK1 is expressed in squamous epithelial cells, where it is associated with keratinization, and in non-specific cells involved in DNA binding.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EGR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1958), [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046), [ZFX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7543), and [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, breast, and blood vessel, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Lymphoma (Burkitt's, Raji), Heart, Thalamus, Lung, Adrenal Cortex, Adrenal Gland, and Testis.


The input data highlights several key biological processes, including cell junction organization, cell-cell communication, cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and the regulation of cytoskeletal remodeling and cell spreading by IPP complex components.
