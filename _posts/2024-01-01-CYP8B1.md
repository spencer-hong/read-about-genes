The gene length is 1,504,183.0 base pairs (99.92% of all genes), the mature length is 1,333.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 1,501,078.5 base pairs.


The gene CYP8B1, with NCBI ID 1582, has been the subject of [9 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CYP8B1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink). The earliest year of publication is 1996, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2000 and 2019.


The top 5 publications mentioning CYP8B1, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[Alpha 1-fetoprotein transcription factor is required for the expression of sterol 12alpha -hydroxylase, the specific enzyme for cholic acid synthesis. Potential role in the bile acid-mediated regulation of gene transcription.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10747975)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 1.98). Other notable publications include "[Conversion of chenodeoxycholic acid to cholic acid by human CYP8B1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30465713)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 1.56), "[Molecular cloning and expression of rabbit sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8943286)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 1.53), "[Suppression of sterol 12alpha-hydroxylase transcription by the short heterodimer partner: insights into the repression mechanism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11574686)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 1.41), and "[Epistane, an anabolic steroid used for recreational purposes, causes cholestasis with elevated levels of cholic acid conjugates, by upregulating bile acid synthesis (CYP8B1) and cross-talking with nuclear receptors in human hepatocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31894354)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 1.4).

The gene [CYP2E1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000110364-CYP2E1) functions as a monooxygenase and oxidoreductase, with evidence supporting its activity at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in some tissues, with notable expression in the liver, forebrain, squamous epithelial cells, and hepatocytes. The gene is particularly associated with liver plasma proteins and metabolic functions in hepatocytes. While it is unprognostic for several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, its role in these contexts remains an area of ongoing investigation.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each with 2 experiments. Additionally, [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) were each found in 1 experiment.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.165 (72.65th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is 6.27 (72.1st percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.993 (16.85th percentile). The protein has a notable affinity for helix (33.13%, 60.4th percentile) and sheet (40.52%, 87.71st percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (25.55%, 25.51st percentile). The instability index is 33.45 (7.74th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 8.78 (73.25th percentile). The protein is 501 amino acids long (58.36th percentile) with a molecular weight of 58067.73 Da (60.77th percentile).
