The gene length is 602 base pairs (0.7% of all genes), the mature length is 264 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 602 base pairs.


RECQL5 has been studied in 51 publications, with the earliest publication in 1999 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2011 and 2016. For more information, see the [51 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RECQL5%22) (note that the count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)).


The top five publications mentioning RECQL5, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that highlight the gene's role in regulating homologous recombination and suppressing tumor formation, controlling transcript elongation, defining distinct homologous recombination subpathways, facilitating anti-recombinase activity, and promoting the resolution of conflicts between replication and transcription. The scientific influence of these papers is measured by the [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541), which field- and time-adjusts the citations received and benchmarks them to the median for NIH publications. The most influential study, "[RECQL5/Recql5 helicase regulates homologous recombination and suppresses tumor formation via disruption of Rad51 presynaptic filaments.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18003859)" (2007), has an RCR of 4.55. Other notable publications include "[RECQL5 controls transcript elongation and suppresses genome instability associated with transcription stress.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24836610)" (2014) with an RCR of 3.3, "[ATRX and RECQ5 define distinct homologous recombination subpathways.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33431668)" (2021) with an RCR of 1.79, "[Physical interaction of RECQ5 helicase with RAD51 facilitates its anti-recombinase activity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20348101)" (2010) with an RCR of 1.37, and "[RECQ5 helicase promotes resolution of conflicts between replication and transcription in human cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27502483)" (2016) with an RCR of 1.34.

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468), and [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.











The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.599 (25.52 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 21.64 at pH 7.0 (94.29 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.01 (80.2 percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 34.11% helix (68.69 percentile), 27.14% sheet (14.99 percentile), and 29.97% turn (63.72 percentile). The instability index is 51.97 (63.52 percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.86 (75.29 percentile). The protein has a length of 991 amino acids (87.33 percentile) and a molecular weight of 108857.13 Da (86.97 percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, which can be found [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
