[TRIOBP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100106-TRIOBP) is an actin-binding protein implicated in deafness and non-syndromic deafness, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. The gene is detected in all RNA tissue distributions and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 7 in blood (non-specific - innate immune response), Cluster 41 in tissue (smooth muscle tissue - ECM organization), Cluster 47 in the brain (endothelial cells - vasculature), Cluster 66 in cell lines (non-specific - mitochondria), and Cluster 54 in single cells (lymphatic endothelial cells - lymph vessel development).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified in terms of the number of CHIP-seq experiments include [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various metabolic disorders such as diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, nutrition diseases, overnutrition, and obesity. Additionally, there are links to cardiovascular system diseases, nervous system diseases, and specific neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, and cognitive disorders. Mental health issues, including diseases of mental health and developmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, are also implicated. Furthermore, the data highlights associations with bone and musculoskeletal diseases, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and connective tissue diseases. Lipid metabolism disorders, lysosomal storage diseases, and fatty liver disease are also noted.


TRIOBP has been associated with several hearing-related conditions through genome-wide association studies. Specifically, it has been linked to [age-related hearing impairment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34108613), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Hearing](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006309) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, TRIOBP is associated with [age-related hearing impairment (low/mid frequency)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31645637), also mapping to the MeSH term [Hearing](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006309). Furthermore, it has been linked to [hearing loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35661827), which directly matches the MeSH term [Hearing Loss](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D034381).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the fallopian tube and cervix uteri, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, prostate, lung, fetal thyroid, and uterus.
