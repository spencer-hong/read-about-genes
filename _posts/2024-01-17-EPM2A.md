The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is located in the [nucleus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634). It acts upstream of or within [positive regulation of macroautophagy](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016239) and [negative regulation of TOR signaling](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032007).


The gene length is 108,150 base pairs (83.37% of all genes), the mature length is 3,759 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 105,090.5 base pairs.


The gene EPM2A (NCBI ID: 7957) has been mentioned in [86 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22EPM2A%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1999 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2007 and 2015. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning EPM2A, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A novel protein tyrosine phosphatase gene is mutated in progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Lafora type (EPM2).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9931343)" (1999) (relative citation ratio: 3.57), "[Insights into Lafora disease: malin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and promotes the degradation of laforin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15930137)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 3.52), "[Laforin, the most common protein mutated in Lafora disease, regulates autophagy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20453062)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 3.52), "[Laforin, a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates complex carbohydrates.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16901901)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 3.24), and "[The phosphatase laforin crosses evolutionary boundaries and links carbohydrate metabolism to neuronal disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17646401)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 2.57). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[EPM2A](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000112425-EPM2A) is a gene encoding a protein with hydrolase and protein phosphatase molecular functions. It is implicated in various diseases, including epilepsy, glycogen storage disease, and neurodegeneration. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in all tissues, with the protein primarily localized in the nucleoplasm. In terms of expression, EPM2A is found in clusters related to basic cellular processes and astrocyte-neuron interactions in the brain, as well as in lymphoma cell lines and neuronal signaling in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) and [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [SMAD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4087), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, cardiac myocytes, pituitary, trigeminal ganglion, skeletal muscle, atrioventricular node, and ciliary ganglion.


The input data highlights several pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism, including general metabolism, glycogen synthesis, and glucose metabolism. Additionally, it includes pathways associated with specific diseases such as myoclonic epilepsy of Lafora, glycogen storage diseases, and general disease pathways.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.235 (65.57th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. At pH 7.0, the protein carries a charge of -4.48 (35.02nd percentile). The median structural flexibility is 0.995 (22.04th percentile), with a propensity for helix, sheet, and turn structures of 32.02% (50.55th percentile), 34.74% (57.15th percentile), and 25.68% (26.6th percentile), respectively. The instability index is 47.07 (46.9th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.19 (35.23rd percentile). The protein has a length of 331 amino acids (34.92nd percentile) and a molecular weight of 37157.15 Da (35.34th percentile). These calculations were performed using BioPython's sequence analysis tools, as detailed [here](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
