The gene length is 23,641 base pairs (46.26% of all genes), the mature length is 2,403 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 23,589 base pairs.


The gene UBC (NCBI ID: 7316) has been the subject of [120 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22UBC%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1974, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2021.


The top 5 publications mentioning UBC, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Clinical utility of serum levels of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase as a biomarker for severe traumatic brain injury.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21937927)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 8.33), "[UbiBrowser 2.0: a comprehensive resource for proteome-wide known and predicted ubiquitin ligase/deubiquitinase-substrate interactions in eukaryotic species.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34669962)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 6.49), "[Protein aggregates are recruited to aggresome by histone deacetylase 6 via unanchored ubiquitin C termini.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22069321)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 3.81), "[Increased persistence of lung gene expression using plasmids containing the ubiquitin C or elongation factor 1alpha promoter.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11704814)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 3.75), and "[Activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system contributes to oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy through muscle atrophy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35025870)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 3.72). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), [ELL2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/22936), and [AFF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4299), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733) was found to be regulating in 5 experiments.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [STAT1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829) and [GATA3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2623), each shown to regulate genes in 3 experiments. [STAT2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6872) and [BCL6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968) were found to regulate genes in 4 experiments each. Additionally, [CEBPB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861) was shown to regulate genes in 2 experiments.





The mouse ortholog gene 22190 and its human ortholog 7316 are associated with several phenotypes. Both sexes exhibit abnormal neural tube closure and abnormal neural tube morphology. Additionally, there is prenatal lethality prior to heart atrial septation, specifically in one sex, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of -0.483 (36.78th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 0.415 at pH 7.0 (51.64th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.010 (81.95th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 32.85% helix (58.08th percentile), 39.56% sheet (84.94th percentile), and 24.96% turn (21.25th percentile). The instability index is 36.13 (12.32nd percentile), with an isoelectric point of 7.16 (52.02nd percentile). The sequence length is 685 amino acids (74.41st percentile), and the molecular weight is 77037.63 Da (74.7th percentile).
