The gene is located in the [Golgi membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000139) and [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020), and is active in the [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794). It is also found in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062). The gene enables [protein phosphatase inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004864) and [alpha-1,6-mannosylglycoprotein 6-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030144), as well as [manganese ion binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030145). It is involved in several processes, including [protein N-linked glycosylation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006487), [protein N-linked glycosylation via asparagine](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0018279), [viral protein processing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019082), [positive regulation of cell migration](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030335), [negative regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1903614), and [positive regulation of receptor signaling pathway via STAT](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1904894).


The gene has a length of 5114.0 base pairs (14.3% of all genes), a mature length of 653.0 base pairs, and a primary transcript length of 2951.5 base pairs.


MGAT5 (Gene ID: 4249) has been mentioned in [105 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22MGAT5%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning MGAT5 was in 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2002 and 2013.


The top five publications mentioning MGAT5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Negative regulation of T-cell activation and autoimmunity by Mgat5 N-glycosylation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11217864)" (2001) with a relative citation ratio of 11.95, "[Suppression of tumor growth and metastasis in Mgat5-deficient mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10700233)" (2000) with a relative citation ratio of 8.14, "[A peptide recognized by human cytolytic T lymphocytes on HLA-A2 melanomas is encoded by an intron sequence of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8642259)" (1996) with a relative citation ratio of 3.46, "[Galectin binding to Mgat5-modified N-glycans regulates fibronectin matrix remodeling in tumor cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16581792)" (2006) with a relative citation ratio of 3.06, and "[Glioma stem cells invasive phenotype at optimal stiffness is driven by MGAT5 dependent mechanosensing.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33894774)" (2021) with a relative citation ratio of 2.88. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[MGAT5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000152127-MGAT5) is a gene encoding a protein with glycosyltransferase and transferase molecular functions, supported by evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in lymphoid tissue related to immune response, oligodendrocytes in the brain, and eosinophils in the blood. The gene is also expressed in various cell lines associated with cell proliferation. However, MGAT5's expression is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including bladder, breast, and lung cancers, among others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TFAP2C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7022) and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), each with 6 experiments. Following closely are [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) and [CDK9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1025), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113) was found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer, diseases of cellular proliferation, and lower respiratory tract diseases such as lung disease. Additionally, the data highlights immune system diseases, metabolic disorders including diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular system diseases. Furthermore, associations with kidney and urinary system diseases, as well as nervous system diseases like neurodegenerative conditions, cognitive disorders, and mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, are noted. The data also includes eye and adnexa diseases, specifically myopia and retinal diseases, and demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, spleen, and small intestine, according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), heart, liver, temporal lobe, skeletal muscle, and uterus corpus.


The input data highlights various diseases and processes related to glycosylation, particularly asparagine N-linked glycosylation. Notably, defects in specific proteins such as ALG2, ALG3, ALG6, ALG8, ALG9, DPAGT1, MAN1B1, MGAT2, MOGS, MPDU1, ALG1, ALG12, ALG11, ALG14, and RFT1 are linked to distinct congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) and other conditions like congenital myasthenic syndrome. Additionally, the data covers broader categories including diseases associated with N-glycosylation of proteins, post-translational protein modification, metabolism of proteins, and various stages of N-glycan antennae elongation and transport to the Golgi.
