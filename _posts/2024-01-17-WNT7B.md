The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [in utero embryonic development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001701), [metanephros morphogenesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003338), and [Wnt signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016055). It enables functions such as [frizzled binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005109), [cytokine activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005125), and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). The gene is located in multiple cellular components, including the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), [endoplasmic reticulum lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005788), [Golgi lumen](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005796), and [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886). Additionally, it is involved in processes like [neuron differentiation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030182), [lung development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030324), and [canonical Wnt signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060070). The gene also plays a role in the development of various tissues, including the [lung](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060425), [trachea](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0060535), and [mammary gland](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0061180). Furthermore, it is located in the [extracellular exosome](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070062) and is involved in processes such as [stem cell proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0072089) and [metanephric collecting duct development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0072205).


The gene length is 8,800.0 base pairs (23.11% of all genes), the mature length is 2,772.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 8,590.5 base pairs.


The gene WNT7B (NCBI ID: 7477) has been mentioned in [64 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22WNT7B%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2014 and 2021.


The top 5 publications mentioning WNT7B, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Sclerostin binds to LRP5/6 and antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15778503)" (2005) with a relative citation ratio of 21.39, "[Reck and Gpr124 Are Essential Receptor Cofactors for Wnt7a/Wnt7b-Specific Signaling in Mammalian CNS Angiogenesis and Blood-Brain Barrier Regulation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28803732)" (2017) with a relative citation ratio of 3.93, "[A Wnt7b-dependent pathway regulates the orientation of epithelial cell division and establishes the cortico-medullary axis of the mammalian kidney.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19060336)" (2009) with a relative citation ratio of 3.56, "[Indoxyl sulfate accelerates vascular smooth muscle cell calcification via microRNA-29b dependent regulation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29195902)" (2018) with a relative citation ratio of 3.39, and "[Wnt7b activates canonical signaling in epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells through interactions with Fzd1, Fzd10, and LRP5.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15923619)" (2005) with a relative citation ratio of 2.72. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[WNT7B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000188064-WNT7B) is a developmental protein with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in many tissues and is associated with Cluster 80 in tissue expression, indicating non-specific endocytosis functions. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 51, which includes neurons with mixed functions. Additionally, WNT7B is found in Cluster 53 of cell line expression, related to squamous epithelial cells and keratinization, and in Cluster 45 of single-cell expression, which has non-specific mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169), [E2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1869), and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.
