The gene enables [protein phosphatase inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004864) and [protein serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004865), and is involved in [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). It is involved in several biological processes, including [glycogen metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005977), [generation of precursor metabolites and energy](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006091), [regulation of signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009966), and [regulation of phosphoprotein phosphatase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043666). Additionally, it enables [molecular function inhibitor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0140678).


The gene length is 21,863 base pairs (44.26% of all genes), the mature length is 2,167 base pairs (56.89% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 21,360 base pairs (53.44% of all genes).


The gene PPP1R2 (NCBI ID: 5504) has been mentioned in [78 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PPP1R2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1946 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 1975 and 1988. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning PPP1R2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Purification, properties, and substrate specificities of phosphoprotein phosphatase(s) from rabbit liver.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8449)" (1976) (relative citation ratio: 6.31), "[The regulation of glycogen metabolism. Purification and properties of protein phosphatase inhibitor-2 from rabbit skeletal muscle.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6245879)" (1980) (relative citation ratio: 3.99), "[The calmodulin-dependent activation and deactivation of the phosphoprotein phosphatase, calcineurin, and the effect of nucleotides, pyrophosphate, and divalent metal ions. Identification of calcineurin as a Zn and Fe metalloenzyme.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6086614)" (1984) (relative citation ratio: 3.79), "[Putting it on and taking it off: phosphoprotein phosphatase involvement in cell cycle regulation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2544293)" (1989) (relative citation ratio: 2.26), and "[Phosphoprotein phosphatase of the human erythrocyte.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/186051)" (1976) (relative citation ratio: 2.13). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PPP1R2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000184203-PPP1R2) functions as a protein phosphatase inhibitor, with evidence supporting its existence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. In blood, PPP1R2 is associated with eosinophils and protein ubiquitination processes. Its expression in various tissues is non-specific with an unknown function, while in the brain, it is linked to neurons and synaptic function. In cell lines, it is involved in protein processing, and in single cells, it is associated with NK-cells, T-cells, and the immune system, as well as transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in muscle and thyroid tissues according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), colorectal adenocarcinoma, small intestine, testis interstitial cells, and testis Leydig cells.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -1.1595 (2.08th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -19.00 (11.83rd percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.025 (98.55th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (41.46%, 95.44th percentile), with lower affinities for sheet (20.98%, 2.7th percentile) and turn (32.68%, 80.31st percentile) structures. The instability index is 59.63 (82.38th percentile), suggesting the protein may be unstable. The isoelectric point is 4.64 (2.41st percentile), with a molecular weight of 23014.96 Da (15.39th percentile). The sequence length is 205 amino acids (15.23rd percentile).
