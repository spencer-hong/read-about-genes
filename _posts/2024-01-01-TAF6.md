The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [E2F8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79733), [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065), and [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), each with 7 experiments. Additionally, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) and [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) were found to be regulating in 6 experiments each.








The mouse ortholog gene 21343 and its human ortholog gene 6878 are associated with phenotypes including embryonic lethality prior to organogenesis, which is not observed in both sexes, and preweaning lethality with complete penetrance, which is observed in both sexes.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.301 (57.92 percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It exhibits a charge of 9.43 at pH 7.0 (80.25 percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.005 (65.61 percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 32.35% helix (53.7 percentile), 32.64% sheet (43.27 percentile), and 31.76% turn (75.34 percentile). The instability index is 50.45 (58.79 percentile), with an isoelectric point of 8.83 (74.69 percentile). The protein has a length of 677 amino acids (73.94 percentile) and a molecular weight of 72667.58 Da (72.18 percentile).
