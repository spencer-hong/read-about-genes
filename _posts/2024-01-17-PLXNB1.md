The gene PLXNB1 (NCBI ID: 5364) has been mentioned in [160 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PLXNB1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1950, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1991 and 2015.


The top five publications mentioning PLXNB1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[The Semaphorin 4D receptor Plexin-B1 is a GTPase activating protein for R-Ras.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15297673)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 5.27), "[Plexin-B1 directly interacts with PDZ-RhoGEF/LARG to regulate RhoA and growth cone morphology.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12123608)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 4.72), "[Effect of TAAR1/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist SEP-363856 on REM sleep in humans.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33879769)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 3.65), "[Sema4D induces angiogenesis through Met recruitment by Plexin B1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632204)" (2005) (relative citation ratio: 3.6), and "[Plexin-B1 is a target of miR-214 in cervical cancer and promotes the growth and invasion of HeLa cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21216304)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 2.99). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PLXNB1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000164050-PLXNB1) is a receptor with evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is classified in Cluster 34 for tissue expression, indicating non-specific mixed function. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 19, associated with astrocytes and mixed function. In cell lines, it is found in Cluster 15, related to kidney cancer and membrane components. Single-cell expression analysis places it in Cluster 47, linked to astrocytes with unknown function.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [ELF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1997) and [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), each with 6 experiments. Additionally, [INTS11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54973), [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), and [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) were each found to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including mental health disorders, substance-related disorders, substance dependence, and specifically, alcohol dependence.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid and prostate, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the prefrontal cortex, retina, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, spinal cord, and colorectal adenocarcinoma.


The proteins are involved in various pathways related to axon guidance and developmental biology. Notably, they participate in sema4d-mediated semaphorin signaling, which includes processes such as cell migration, growth-cone collapse, and inhibition of cell attachment. Additionally, these proteins are implicated in g alpha (12/13) signaling events, gpcr downstream signaling, and broader signal transduction pathways.
