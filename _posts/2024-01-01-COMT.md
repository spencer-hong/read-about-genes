The gene length is 16,420 base pairs (37.17% of all genes), the mature length is 440 base pairs (0.94% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 698 base pairs (0.9% of all genes).


The gene COMT (NCBI ID: 1312) has been the subject of [2,197 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22COMT%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication dating back to 1961. The middle 50% of these publications were published between 2004 and 2015. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning COMT, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Effect of COMT Val108/158 Met genotype on frontal lobe function and risk for schizophrenia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11381111)" (2001) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 43.58, "[Human catechol-O-methyltransferase pharmacogenetics: description of a functional polymorphism and its potential application to neuropsychiatric disorders.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8807664)" (1996) with an RCR of 41.59, "[Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Guideline for CYP2D6, OPRM1, and COMT Genotypes and Select Opioid Therapy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33387367)" (2021) with an RCR of 29.14, "[COMT val158met genotype affects mu-opioid neurotransmitter responses to a pain stressor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12595695)" (2003) with an RCR of 21.46, and "[Moderation of the effect of adolescent-onset cannabis use on adult psychosis by a functional polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene: longitudinal evidence of a gene X environment interaction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15866551)" (2005) with an RCR of 20.58. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) and [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), and [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [2118](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2118), [8243](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8243), [6879](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6879), and [9126](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126). Each of these TFs was shown to be regulating genes in one Perturb-seq experiment.


The COMT gene has been associated with various traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [2-o-methylascorbic acid levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35347128), which maps to the MeSH term [Acids](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000143) using the BioWordVec method. Additionally, COMT is associated with [3-methoxytyrosine levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36635386), mapping to [Dihydroxyphenylalanine](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004295), and [Body mass index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36581621), directly matching the MeSH term [Body Mass Index](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015992). Furthermore, COMT has been implicated in [Internet addiction disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36566681), which directly matches the MeSH term [Internet Addiction Disorder](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000082424). Other associations include various metabolite levels in chronic kidney disease, such as [Plasma 2-O-methylascorbic acid levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37277652) mapping to [Disease](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004194), and urinary metabolite levels mapping to [Kidney](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007668). These findings highlight the diverse roles of COMT in human physiology and disease.


The mouse ortholog gene 12846 and its human ortholog gene 1312 are associated with several phenotypic traits. Both sexes exhibit decreased anxiety-related responses, decreased circulating fructosamine levels, decreased hemoglobin content, and increased grip strength.


The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of 0.1598 (89.55th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -9.84 (22.77th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.9901 (11.57th percentile). The protein has a notable affinity for helix (0.3690, 84.79th percentile) and sheet (0.3985, 85.8th percentile) structures, with a lower affinity for turns (0.2509, 22.22nd percentile). The instability index is 33.4952 (7.77th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 5.2585 (12.62nd percentile).
