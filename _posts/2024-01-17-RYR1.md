[RYR1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196218-RYR1) is a multifunctional gene that encodes a protein involved in calcium channel activity, calmodulin-binding, and ion channel functions. It is also a developmental protein and a ligand-gated ion channel receptor. The gene is implicated in disease variants and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. RYR1 is detected in many tissues and is localized in the Golgi apparatus, vesicles, and cytosol. Its expression is enriched in monocytes involved in innate immune response, skeletal muscle for striated muscle contraction, hypothalamus for neuropeptide signaling, sarcoma cell lines for muscle contraction, and skeletal myocytes for muscle contraction.
