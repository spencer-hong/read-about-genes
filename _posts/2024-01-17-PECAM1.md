The gene length is 26,327 base pairs (49.05% of all genes), the mature length is 4,937.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 18,614.5 base pairs.


The gene PECAM1 (NCBI ID: 5175) has been mentioned in [420 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22PECAM1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1990, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2001 and 2015.


The top five publications mentioning PECAM1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Angiogenesis, assessed by platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule antibodies, as indicator of node metastases and survival in breast cancer.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1279332)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 22.87), "[PECAM-1 is required for transendothelial migration of leukocytes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8340753)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 22.25), "[PECAM-1 (CD31) cloning and relation to adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1690453)" (1990) (relative citation ratio: 19.58), "[Involvement of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 in neutrophil recruitment in vivo.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8248808)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 9.6), and "[Involvement of endothelial PECAM-1/CD31 in angiogenesis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9284815)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 9.03). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[PECAM1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000261371-PECAM1) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoli and plasma membrane. PECAM1 is highly expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, contributing to the innate immune response. It is also prominently expressed in the placenta during pregnancy, endothelial cells in the brain vasculature, and adipocytes and endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RELA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5970), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with several disease conditions, including lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, respiratory system disease, coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, and cardiovascular system disease. Additionally, broader categories such as disease and disease of anatomical entity are also implicated.



The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including CD33+ Myeloid cells, BDCA4+ Dendritic Cells, CD14+ Monocytes, Whole Blood, Lung, Placenta, Fetal Lung, and Lymph Node.


The input data highlights several pathways involving platelet function and interactions, including platelet sensitization by LDL, PECAM1 interactions, platelet homeostasis, and platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation. Additionally, it covers processes related to hemostasis, platelet degranulation, and the response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca2+. Other notable pathways include extracellular matrix organization, integrin cell surface interactions, and cell surface interactions at the vascular wall.
