The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and is located in the [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654). It is involved in [mRNA processing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006397) and [RNA splicing](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008380).


The gene length is 23,969 base pairs (46.61% of all genes), the mature length is 2,059.5 base pairs (54.33% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 19,859.5 base pairs (51.46% of all genes).


The gene CLASRP (NCBI ID: 11129) has been mentioned in [30 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CLASRP%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 1978, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2011 and 2020.


The top five publications mentioning CLASRP, ranked by their scientific influence, are as follows. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. The most influential publication is "[1-Year Outcomes for Transcatheter Repair in Patients With Mitral Regurgitation From the CLASP Study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33092709)" (2020) with a relative citation ratio of 3.45. Following this, "[2-Year Outcomes for Transcatheter Repair in Patients With Mitral Regurgitation From the CLASP Study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34020928)" (2021) has a relative citation ratio of 3.36. Additionally, "[CLASP promotes microtubule rescue by recruiting tubulin dimers to the microtubule.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20708587)" (2010) has a relative citation ratio of 3.13. "[CLASP Suppresses Microtubule Catastrophes through a Single TOG Domain.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29937387)" (2018) has a relative citation ratio of 2.55, and "[GSK3beta phosphorylation modulates CLASP-microtubule association and lamella microtubule attachment.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19289791)" (2009) has a relative citation ratio of 2.54.

[CLASRP](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000104859-CLASRP) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily located in the nucleoplasm and is associated with non-specific transcriptional functions across various tissue and cell line expression clusters. The gene is also linked to immune response functions in the brain. Notably, CLASRP is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma, among others.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 6 experiments, followed by [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), and [TP53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157), each with 5 experiments.



The input data indicates associations with various disease conditions, including general diseases, diseases of anatomical entities, kidney diseases, and urinary system diseases.



The gene is expressed in the pituitary and spleen according to BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in Lymphoma (Burkitt's, Raji), Heart, CD19+ B Cells (neg. sel.), CD71+ Early Erythroid cells, and Skeletal Muscle.
