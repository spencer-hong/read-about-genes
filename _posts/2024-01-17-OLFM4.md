The gene OLFM4 (NCBI ID: 10562) has been mentioned in [100 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22OLFM4%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest publication mentioning this gene was in 1968, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2010 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning OLFM4, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[OLFM4 is a robust marker for stem cells in human intestine and marks a subset of colorectal cancer cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19450592)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 7.39), "[Group-specific component: evidence for two subtypes of the Gc1 gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/73222)" (1977) (relative citation ratio: 6.93), "[Olfactomedin 4 defines a subset of human neutrophils.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22187488)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 2.69), "[Olfactomedin-4 Is a Candidate Marker for a Pathogenic Neutrophil Subset in Septic Shock.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27635771)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 2.66), and "[A quantitative proteomic approach of the different stages of colorectal cancer establishes OLFM4 as a new nonmetastatic tumor marker.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21986994)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 2.53). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[OLFM4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000102837-OLFM4) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many tissues. It is primarily located in the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, cytokinetic bridge, and cytosol. The gene is highly expressed in the intestine, specifically in intestinal goblet cells involved in mucin production, and is also found in stomach and colon cancer cell lines. While OLFM4's molecular function and disease involvement are not specified, its expression patterns suggest a role in digestive processes. The gene's prognostic value in various cancers, including bladder, breast, and colorectal cancers, has been studied, but it is generally considered unprognostic.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NFE2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4778) with 2 experiments, [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) with 1 experiment, [RBPJ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3516) with 1 experiment, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 1 experiment, and [TBPL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9519) with 1 experiment.
