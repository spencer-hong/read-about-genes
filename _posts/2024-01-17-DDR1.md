The gene is involved in various biological processes, including [regulation of cell growth](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001558), [regulation of cell-matrix adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001952), [cell adhesion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007155), and [transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007169). It enables functions such as [transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004714), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), [collagen binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005518), and [ATP binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524). The gene is located in the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615) and the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and is part of the [receptor complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043235). Additionally, it plays roles in developmental processes like [multicellular organism development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007275), [embryo implantation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007566), [lactation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007595), and [ear development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043583). The gene is also involved in [cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008283) and its negative regulation, as well as processes related to the extracellular matrix and neuron projection development. Notably, the gene is not involved in the [positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0070374).


The gene has a length of 58,848 base pairs (70.49th percentile), a mature length of 2,205 base pairs (57.68th percentile), and a primary transcript length of 51,997 base pairs (76.2th percentile).


The gene DDR1 (NCBI ID: 780) has been mentioned in [169 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22DDR1%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning DDR1 is 1993, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2012 and 2020.


The top 5 publications mentioning DDR1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Tumour DDR1 promotes collagen fibre alignment to instigate immune exclusion.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34732895)" (2021) with a [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) of 9.31, "[Targeting Discoidin Domain Receptors DDR1 and DDR2 overcomes matrix-mediated tumor cell adaptation and tolerance to BRAF-targeted therapy in melanoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957688)" (2022) with an RCR of 4.5, "[Combined inhibition of DDR1 and Notch signaling is a therapeutic strategy for KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26855149)" (2016) with an RCR of 4.29, "[DNA-Encoded Library-Derived DDR1 Inhibitor Prevents Fibrosis and Renal Function Loss in a Genetic Mouse Model of Alport Syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30452219)" (2019) with an RCR of 4.21, and "[DDR1-induced neutrophil extracellular traps drive pancreatic cancer metastasis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34237033)" (2021) with an RCR of 4.01. The Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[DDR1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204580-DDR1) is a kinase and receptor with transferase activity, specifically functioning as a tyrosine-protein kinase. Evidence supports its existence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized in the nucleoplasm, plasma membrane, and cytosol. It is expressed in various tissue clusters, including non-specific mixed function tissues (Cluster 34), astrocytes (Cluster 19), squamous epithelial cells involved in keratinization (Cluster 53), and respiratory epithelial cells (Cluster 35).


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), each shown to be regulating in 6 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as those caused by viral agents, specifically human immunodeficiency virus infectious disease and hepatitis B. Respiratory conditions are also prominent, encompassing asthma, bronchial disease, obstructive lung disease, lower respiratory tract disease, lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, the data highlights vascular and cardiovascular system diseases, as well as integumentary system diseases like psoriasis. Other notable conditions include Beh√ßet's disease, vasculitis, and general respiratory system and skin diseases.



The gene is expressed in the salivary gland, as well as in various tissues including the retina, hypothalamus, spinal cord, and fetal thyroid.


The proteins are involved in extracellular matrix organization and non-integrin membrane-ECM interactions.


The mouse ortholog gene 12305 and its human ortholog gene 780 are associated with phenotypes such as hyperactivity and preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance, observed in both sexes.
