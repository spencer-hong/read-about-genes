The gene enables [complement component C3b binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001851) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), including [identical protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042802). It is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576) and is active in the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615), as well as in [blood microparticles](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0072562). The gene is involved in [complement activation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006956), [negative regulation of protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032091), and [cytolysis by host of symbiont cells](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051838). Additionally, it is part of a [protein-containing complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0032991).


The gene length is 5,796 base pairs (16.01% of all genes), the mature length is 454 base pairs (1.08% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 5,603 base pairs (20.54% of all genes).


The gene CFHR1 (NCBI ID: 3078) has been mentioned in [63 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CFHR1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1973 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2012 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning CFHR1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Association of factor H autoantibodies with deletions of CFHR1, CFHR3, CFHR4, and with mutations in CFH, CFI, CD46, and C3 in patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19861685)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 8.19), "[A common CFH haplotype, with deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3, is associated with lower risk of age-related macular degeneration.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16998489)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 7.73), "[Factor H autoantibodies in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome correlate with CFHR1/CFHR3 deficiency.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18006700)" (2008) (relative citation ratio: 7.13), "[Deletion of complement factor H-related genes CFHR1 and CFHR3 is associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17367211)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 6.05), and "[Variants in Complement Factor H and Complement Factor H-Related Protein Genes, CFHR3 and CFHR1, Affect Complement Activation in IgA Nephropathy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25205734)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 4.53). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CFHR1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000244414-CFHR1) is a gene involved in cancer-related processes and hemolytic uremic syndrome, with evidence supporting its function at the protein level. The gene's RNA is detected in some tissues, and its protein is localized in vesicles. CFHR1 is highly expressed in the liver, contributing to plasma proteins, and is also involved in monoamine and neurotransmitter signaling in the brain. In single-cell expression studies, it is associated with hepatocytes and metabolism. The gene is unprognostic in several cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 2 experiments, [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908) with 1 experiment, [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) with 1 experiment, [ASCL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/429) with 1 experiment, and [STAT5A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6776) with 1 experiment.



The input data indicates a focus on various disease conditions, particularly those affecting the nervous system and sensory systems. Specifically, the data highlights eye and adnexa diseases, with a notable emphasis on retinal diseases such as retinal degeneration and age-related macular degeneration. Additionally, the data includes degeneration of the macula and posterior pole, as well as general macular degeneration.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including liver and nerve.



The mouse ortholog gene 50702 and its human ortholog gene 3078 are associated with the phenotype of limb grasping, observed in both sexes.
