The gene enables [GTPase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003924) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is part of the [heterotrimeric G-protein complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005834). It is located in the [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886) and is involved in [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165) and the [G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007186). Additionally, it enables [G-protein beta-subunit binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031681).


The gene length is 167,885 base pairs (90.47% of all genes), the mature length is 1,651.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 88,592 base pairs (86.55% of all genes).


The gene GNG11 (NCBI ID: 2791) has been mentioned in [2 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22GNG11%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2006, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2009 to 2017.


The top publications mentioning GNG11 include "[G-protein gamma subunit GNG11 strongly regulates cellular senescence.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17092487)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 0.81) and "[Assessment of Significant Pathway Signaling and Prognostic Value of GNG11 in Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34113163)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.73). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[GNG11](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000127920-GNG11) is a gene that functions as a transducer, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, and it is notably expressed in neutrophils within the blood, adipose tissue, endothelial cells in the brain, and kidney cancer cell lines. Additionally, GNG11 is found in platelets, where it plays a role in hemostasis.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [PPARG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5468) and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), and [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) were each found to be regulating in 2 experiments.





The gene is expressed in adipose tissue, breast, and ovary according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in cardiac myocytes, retina, whole blood, smooth muscle, lung, placenta, and appendix.


The input data highlights various biological pathways, including metabolism, transmembrane transport of small molecules, and multiple signaling pathways such as beta-catenin independent WNT signaling, G-protein signaling events, and thrombin signaling through proteinase activated receptors (PARs). Additionally, the data covers processes related to neurotransmitter receptor binding, hemostasis, and platelet activation.



The analyzed protein sequence exhibits a GRAVY value of -0.978 (4.88th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -2.404 (41.61st percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 1.033 (99.6th percentile). The protein has a high affinity for helix structures (0.452, 98.36th percentile), with lower affinities for sheet and turn structures (0.247 each, 7.96th and 19.16th percentiles, respectively). The instability index is 82.67 (98.65th percentile), suggesting high instability. The isoelectric point is 5.47 (17.42nd percentile), and the protein is relatively short with a length of 73 amino acids (0.79th percentile) and a molecular weight of 8480.68 Da (0.93rd percentile).
