The gene is located in the [kinetochore](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000776) and [nucleoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005654), and is also found in the [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829). It is involved in [mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint signaling](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007094), [attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochore](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008608), [protein localization to kinetochore](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0034501), [cell division](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051301), and [meiotic cell cycle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0051321). Additionally, it enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and [ubiquitin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043130). The gene is part of the [mitotic checkpoint complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0033597) and the [bub1-bub3 complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1990298).


The gene length is 91,437 base pairs (80.22 percentile of all genes), the mature length is 13,761 base pairs (99.74 percentile of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 88,989 base pairs (86.63 percentile of all genes).


The gene BUB3 (NCBI ID: 9184) has been mentioned in [53 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22BUB3%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning BUB3 is 1998, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2003 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning BUB3, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Checkpoint inhibition of the APC/C in HeLa cells is mediated by a complex of BUBR1, BUB3, CDC20, and MAD2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11535616)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 10.51), "[The human homologue of Bub3 is required for kinetochore localization of Bub1 and a Mad3/Bub1-related protein kinase.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9660858)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 5.64), "[Phosphodependent recruitment of Bub1 and Bub3 to Spc7/KNL1 by Mph1 kinase maintains the spindle checkpoint.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22521786)" (2012) (relative citation ratio: 5.0), "[Rae1 is an essential mitotic checkpoint regulator that cooperates with Bub3 to prevent chromosome missegregation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12551952)" (2003) (relative citation ratio: 4.6), and "[Bub3 reads phosphorylated MELT repeats to promote spindle assembly checkpoint signaling.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24066227)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 4.05). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[BUB3](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154473-BUB3) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily located in the nucleoplasm and is associated with cell proliferation in various tissues, including lymphoid tissue and bone marrow. BUB3 is also expressed in the hindbrain and is found in NK-cells and T-cells, playing a role in the immune system and transcription.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367), [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [JUN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3725), [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297), and [ETS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2113), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including skin, spleen, and small intestine, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in 721_B_lymphoblasts, CD56+_NKCells, CD8+_Tcells, Leukemia_promyelocytic-HL-60, Lymphoma_burkitts(Daudi), and Leukemialymphoblastic(MOLT-4).


The input data highlights various pathways involving the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its role in cell cycle regulation. Key processes include APC/C-mediated degradation of cell cycle proteins, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, and activation of APC/C and APC/C:Cdc20-mediated degradation of mitotic proteins. Additionally, the data covers specific phases and checkpoints of the cell cycle, such as mitotic anaphase, mitotic metaphase, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint. The regulation of APC/C activators between G1/S and early anaphase, as well as the degradation of specific proteins like Cyclin A and Nek2A, are also noted.



The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.514 (33.52nd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7 is -2.67 (40.71st percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.998 (33.21st percentile). The protein has a length of 328 amino acids (34.37th percentile) and a molecular weight of 37154.35 Da (35.33rd percentile). The secondary structure affinities are 24.09% for helix (3.62nd percentile), 35.67% for sheet (64.03rd percentile), and 31.71% for turn (75.09th percentile). The instability index is 47.37 (47.84th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 6.36 (39.58th percentile). These calculations were performed using [BioPython's sequence analysis tools](https://biopython.org/docs/1.75/api/Bio.SeqUtils.ProtParam.html).
