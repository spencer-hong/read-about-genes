[ST6GAL1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000073849-ST6GAL1) is a gene encoding a protein with glycosyltransferase and transferase molecular functions, supported by evidence at the protein level. Its RNA is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in the liver, where it is involved in metabolism. In the brain, it is expressed in macrophages and microglia, suggesting a role in immune response. Additionally, ST6GAL1 is expressed in myeloma cell lines and hepatocytes, further indicating its involvement in immune response and metabolism, respectively.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861) with 6 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 5 experiments, [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 5 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 5 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as gastrointestinal system cancer, hematologic cancer, and immune system cancer. Metabolic disorders are also prominent, with links to type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome X. Cardiovascular and vascular diseases, including hypertension and artery disease, are noted. Neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease and dementia are included, along with mental health disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Additionally, the data highlights musculoskeletal system diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, liver diseases including hepatitis, and immune system disorders such as agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency.



The gene is expressed in the liver and spleen according to the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles indicate expression in the liver, BDCA4+ dendritic cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells (neg. sel.), and fetal liver.


The input data highlights various diseases and processes related to glycosylation, including diseases of glycosylation and asparagine N-linked glycosylation. Specific defects in genes such as ALG2, ALG3, ALG6, ALG8, ALG9, DPAGT1, MAN1B1, MGAT2, MOGS, MPDU1, ALG1, ALG12, ALG11, ALG14, and RFT1 are associated with different types of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) and other conditions like congenital myasthenic syndrome (ALG14-CMS) and MRT15. The data also covers broader categories such as diseases associated with N-glycosylation of proteins, post-translational protein modification, biosynthesis of the N-glycan precursor, synthesis of substrates in N-glycan biosynthesis, sialic acid metabolism, metabolism of proteins, N-glycan antennae elongation, transport to the Golgi and subsequent modification, O-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation of mucins, and termination of O-glycan biosynthesis.
