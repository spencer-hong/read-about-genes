[CDK5R1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000176749-CDK5R1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in many tissues. It is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and vesicles. The gene is part of Cluster 33 in blood expression, which is non-specific and involved in ATP binding. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 22, which is associated with brain synaptic signal transduction. CDK5R1 is also part of Cluster 51 in brain expression, which is related to neurons with mixed functions, and Cluster 55 in cell line expression, which is associated with lymphoma and immune response. Additionally, it is part of Cluster 71 in single-cell expression, which is related to horizontal and bipolar cells involved in neuronal signaling.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 5 experiments, followed by [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624), [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), and [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597), each with 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, whole brain, fetal brain, cingulate cortex, subthalamic nucleus, occipital lobe, and cerebellum. Additionally, it is expressed in the pituitary and spleen.


The proteins are involved in several pathways related to axon guidance and developmental biology, including CRMPs in Sema3A signaling and semaphorin interactions.
