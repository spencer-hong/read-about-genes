The gene enables [erythropoietin receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004900) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and is involved in [signal transduction](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007165), [brain development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007420), [heart development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007507), [positive regulation of cell population proliferation](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008284), [cytokine-mediated signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0019221), [hemopoiesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030097), [erythropoietin-mediated signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0038162), and [decidualization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046697). It is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005886), and [nuclear speck](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016607), and is active on the [external side of plasma membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0009897). Additionally, it enables [identical protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042802).


The gene length is 1,589 base pairs (4.02% of all genes), the mature length is 478 base pairs (1.38% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 1,499 base pairs (4.44% of all genes).


The gene EPOR (NCBI ID: 2057) has been mentioned in [455 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22EPOR%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning EPOR is 1988, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2012.


The top five publications mentioning EPOR, ranked by their scientific influence, include [JAK2 associates with the erythropoietin receptor and is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated following stimulation with erythropoietin.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8343951) (1993) (relative citation ratio: 21.52), [Specific recruitment of SH-PTP1 to the erythropoietin receptor causes inactivation of JAK2 and termination of proliferative signals.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7889566) (1995) (relative citation ratio: 16.01), [Generation of committed erythroid BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors does not require erythropoietin or the erythropoietin receptor.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7553874) (1995) (relative citation ratio: 15.71), [Erythropoietin receptor mRNA expression in human endothelial cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8171022) (1994) (relative citation ratio: 12.68), and [Erythropoietin receptor activation by a ligand-induced conformation change.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9974393) (1999) (relative citation ratio: 8.64). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[EPOR](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000187266-EPOR) is a receptor involved in various diseases, including cancer-related genes, congenital erythrocytosis, and is a target for FDA-approved drugs. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. The gene is detected in all tissues, with notable expression in nuclear speckles and the plasma membrane. It is particularly expressed in neutrophils, the thyroid gland, and erythroid cells, where it plays roles in protein binding, unknown functions, and oxygen transport, respectively. In cell lines, it is associated with leukemia and hemostasis.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [FLI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2313) with 6 experiments, [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) and [KMT2B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9757) each with 5 experiments, and [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) and [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942) each with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent detection in CHIP-seq studies.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the thyroid and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the thyroid, CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, bone marrow, fetal liver, superior cervical ganglion, and atrioventricular node.




The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.0704724409448819 (80.12th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -28.639036976212907 (6.52nd percentile), suggesting a negatively charged protein. The median structural flexibility is 1.0003690476190477 (43.34th percentile), and the protein has an instability index of 48.03622047244102 (50.37th percentile). The isoelectric point is 4.641892814636231 (2.46th percentile), with a length of 508 amino acids (59.26th percentile) and a molecular weight of 55064.74130000008 Da (57.41st percentile).
