The gene length is 715,386 base pairs (99.17% of all genes), the mature length is 2,203 base pairs (57.62% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 505,076 base pairs (99.26% of all genes).


The gene SLC25A15 has an NCBI Gene ID of 10166. It has been featured in [10 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22SLC25A15%22) (note: the count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication is 2000, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2006 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning SLC25A15, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[A novel long noncoding RNA Lnc-HC binds hnRNPA2B1 to regulate expressions of Cyp7a1 and Abca1 in hepatocytic cholesterol metabolism.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26663205)" (2016) with a relative citation ratio of 3.72, "[Identification of novel mutations in the SLC25A15 gene in hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria (HHH) syndrome: a clinical, molecular, and functional study.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19242930)" (2009) with a relative citation ratio of 1.16, "[Phenotypic variability among patients with hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome homozygous for the delF188 mutation in SLC25A15.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18978333)" (2008) with a relative citation ratio of 0.82, "[A novel mutation in the SLC25A15 gene in a Turkish patient with HHH syndrome: functional analysis of the mutant protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24721342)" (2014) with a relative citation ratio of 0.78, and "[Cloning and characterization of human ORNT2: a second mitochondrial ornithine transporter that can rescue a defective ORNT1 in patients with the hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome, a urea cycle disorder.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12948741)" (2003) with a relative citation ratio of 0.63. The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).





The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 5 experiments, [BRD2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6046) with 5 experiments, [HNF4A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3172) with 5 experiments, [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065) with 4 experiments, and [FOXA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3169) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.








The mouse ortholog gene 18408 and its human ortholog gene 10166 are associated with abnormal kidney morphology and increased total body fat amount, with these phenotypes observed in both sexes.


The protein sequence analyzed has a GRAVY value of 0.197 (90.46th percentile), indicating a relatively hydrophobic nature. It exhibits a charge of 11.5 at pH 7.0 (84.26th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 0.993 (15.96th percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be 33.6% helix (64.16th percentile), 38.2% sheet (79.62nd percentile), and 27.2% turn (40.24th percentile). The instability index is 33.3 (7.57th percentile), with an isoelectric point of 9.28 (86.41st percentile). The protein has a length of 301 amino acids (28.72nd percentile) and a molecular weight of 32735.9 Da (27.51st percentile).
