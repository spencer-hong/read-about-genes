The gene is located in the [Golgi membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000139), [endoplasmic reticulum membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005789), [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), [cytosol](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005829), [ER to Golgi transport vesicle membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0012507), [endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0033116), and [vesicle](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031982). It is active in the [endomembrane system](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0012505) and enables [SNARE binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000149), [SNAP receptor activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005484), [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515), and [cadherin binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045296). The gene is involved in various processes including [intracellular protein transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006886), [endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006888), [vesicle fusion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006906), [early endosome to Golgi transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0034498), [retrograde transport, endosome to Golgi](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042147), [positive regulation of protein catabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0045732), [vesicle docking](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048278), [vesicle fusion with Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0048280), [Golgi disassembly](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0090166), and [regulation of Golgi organization](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1903358). Additionally, it is part of the [SNARE complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031201).


The gene length is 13,516 base pairs (32.47% of all genes), the mature length is 2,285.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 12,918.5 base pairs.


The gene STX5 (NCBI ID: 6811) has been mentioned in [29 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22STX5%22) (note: count may differ as it is sourced from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning STX5 is 1994, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2002 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning STX5, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Participation of the syntaxin 5/Ykt6/GS28/GS15 SNARE complex in transport from the early/recycling endosome to the trans-Golgi network.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15215310)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 2.24), "[Syntaxin 5 regulates endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7961911)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 2.15), "[Syntaxin 5-dependent retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network is required for adeno-associated virus transduction.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25410859)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 1.97), "[Sly1 protein bound to Golgi syntaxin Sed5p allows assembly and contributes to specificity of SNARE fusion complexes.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11994317)" (2002) (relative citation ratio: 1.88), and "[Syntaxin 16 and syntaxin 5 are required for efficient retrograde transport of several exogenous and endogenous cargo proteins.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17389686)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 1.71). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[STX5](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000162236-STX5) is a gene involved in congenital disorders of glycosylation, with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all RNA tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and Golgi apparatus. STX5 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 45 in eosinophils with unknown function, Cluster 68 in non-specific tissues related to protein processing, Cluster 55 in the brain associated with transcription, Cluster 24 in non-specific cell lines with unknown function, and Cluster 27 in syncytiotrophoblasts related to pregnancy.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [MYCN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4613), [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), [RAD21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5885), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 5 experiments, and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 4 experiments.
