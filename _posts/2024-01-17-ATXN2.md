The gene ATXN2 (NCBI ID: 6311) has been mentioned in [342 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ATXN2%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication mentioning this gene is 1988, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2005 and 2018.


The top 5 publications mentioning ATXN2, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Ataxin-2 intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions are associated with increased risk for ALS.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20740007)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 20.97), "[Moderate expansion of a normally biallelic trinucleotide repeat in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8896555)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 18.92), "[Identification of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene using a direct identification of repeat expansion and cloning technique, DIRECT.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8896556)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 12.96), "[Therapeutic reduction of ataxin-2 extends lifespan and reduces pathology in TDP-43 mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28405022)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 12.75), and "[Loss of C9ORF72 impairs autophagy and synergizes with polyQ Ataxin-2 to induce motor neuron dysfunction and cell death.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27103069)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 10.45). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ATXN2](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204842-ATXN2) is implicated in several diseases, including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Neurodegeneration, Parkinsonism, and Spinocerebellar ataxia. The gene's expression is detected in all RNA tissue distributions, with its protein product primarily located in the cytosol. ATXN2 is part of various expression clusters, including Cluster 5 for blood expression related to non-specific cell proliferation, Cluster 79 for tissue expression related to non-specific transcription, Cluster 4 for brain expression related to non-specific mRNA splicing and cell cycle, Cluster 38 for cell line expression related to non-specific transcription, and Cluster 55 for single cell expression related to non-specific transcription. Evidence for the gene's function is available at the protein level.
