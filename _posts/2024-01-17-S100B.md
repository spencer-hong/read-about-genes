The gene S100B, with NCBI ID 6285, has been mentioned in [2,532 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22S100B%22) (count may differ as it is from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727)). The earliest year of publication mentioning S100B is 1980, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 2002 and 2015.


The top 5 publications mentioning S100B, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Importance of the nef gene for maintenance of high virus loads and for development of AIDS.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2032289)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 32.21), "[Protective effects of a live attenuated SIV vaccine with a deletion in the nef gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1470917)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 21.76), "[The S100 protein family: history, function, and expression.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7620916)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 19.97), "[Brief report: absence of intact nef sequences in a long-term survivor with nonprogressive HIV-1 infection.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7808489)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 18.55), and "[Endocytosis of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules is induced by the HIV-1 Nef protein.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8612235)" (1996) (relative citation ratio: 16.16). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[S100B](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000160307-S100B) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is localized in various subcellular compartments, including the nucleoplasm, vesicles, microtubules, primary cilium, basal body, and cytosol. The gene is part of Cluster 24 for blood expression, which is non-specific and related to transcription. In tissue expression, it belongs to Cluster 9, associated with oligodendrocytes and myelination. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 30, related to white matter and myelination. Additionally, S100B is found in Cluster 69 for cell line expression, linked to skin cancer and ECM organization, and in Cluster 26 for single-cell expression, associated with Schwann cells and melanocytes with mixed functions.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 5 experiments, followed by [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), [BRD3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8019), and [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), each with 4 experiments.



The input data highlights a diverse range of disease conditions associated with GWAS studies, including various forms of cancer such as leukemia, lymphoma, and immune system cancers. Additionally, respiratory conditions like asthma, bronchial disease, and obstructive lung disease are noted. Metabolic disorders, particularly diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, are also prominent. Furthermore, the data encompasses cardiovascular system diseases and broader categories such as hematopoietic system disease and immune system disease.



The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including adipose tissue, nerve, and brain, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the retina, hypothalamus, spinal cord, thalamus, parietal lobe, cerebellum, dorsal root ganglion, and olfactory bulb.


The input data highlights various pathways involved in the immune system, particularly focusing on innate immune responses. Key pathways include signaling by ERBB4, activated TLR4 signaling, and multiple toll-like receptor (TLR) cascades such as TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7/8, TLR9, and TLR10. Additionally, the data covers MyD88-dependent and independent cascades, TRIF-mediated signaling, and TRAF6-mediated induction of NF-kB and proinflammatory cytokines. Other notable pathways include RIG-I/MDA5 mediated induction of IFN-alpha/beta, ZBP1-mediated induction of type I IFNs, and advanced glycosylation endproduct receptor signaling. The data also mentions nuclear signaling by ERBB4 and general signal transduction processes.
