The gene is located in the [mitochondrion](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005739) and specifically in the [mitochondrial inner membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005743). It is part of the [mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complex](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005753), including the [coupling factor F(o)](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000276). The gene enables [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515) and contributes to [proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, rotational mechanism](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0046933). It is involved in [proton motive force-driven ATP synthesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0015986), [proton motive force-driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0042776), and [proton transmembrane transport](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:1902600).


The gene length is 47,490 base pairs (64.97th percentile), the mature length is 1,475.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 22,373 base pairs (54.7th percentile).


The gene ATP5ME (NCBI ID: 521) has been mentioned in [1 publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22ATP5ME%22) (count from [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), may differ from the hyperlink count). The earliest year of publication is 2021, and the middle 50% of publications range from 2021 to 2021.


The top publication mentioning ATP5ME is "[TRESK Regulates Gm11874 to Induce Apoptosis of Spinal Cord Neurons via ATP5i Mediated Oxidative Stress and DNA Damage.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33973102)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 0.51). The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, and benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, the value of which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[ATP5ME](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000169020-ATP5ME) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, detected in all RNA tissue distributions. It is primarily localized in the mitochondria and is associated with various expression clusters, including Cluster 29 for blood (non-specific - unknown function), Cluster 23 for tissue (non-specific - cellular respiration), Cluster 28 for brain (oligodendrocytes - mixed function), Cluster 22 for cell line (non-specific - mRNA splicing & cell cycle), and Cluster 68 for single cell (cardiomyocytes - muscle contraction). The gene is unprognostic for multiple cancer types, including Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SIN3A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25942) with 6 experiments, followed by [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), [HDAC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3065), and [GTF2F1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2962), each with 5 experiments.





The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including the heart, colon, and kidney, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the heart, colon, hypothalamus, thalamus, skeletal muscle, and promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60).


The input data highlights several key metabolic processes, including the formation of ATP by chemiosmotic coupling, respiratory electron transport, and the citric acid (TCA) cycle. These processes are integral to cellular metabolism and energy production.



The analyzed protein sequence exhibits a GRAVY value of -0.571 (27.94th percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. It has a charge of 2.52 at pH 7.0 (59.38th percentile) and a median structural flexibility of 1.01 (82.32nd percentile). The protein's secondary structure is predicted to be predominantly helical with a helix affinity of 0.46 (98.94th percentile), followed by sheet (0.32, 38.85th percentile) and turn (0.20, 2.85th percentile) conformations. The instability index is 52.31 (64.57th percentile), and the isoelectric point is 9.34 (87.96th percentile). The protein is relatively short with a length of 69 amino acids (0.6th percentile) and has a molecular weight of 7933.11 Da (0.67th percentile).
