The gene length is 54,929.0 base pairs (68.97% of all genes), the mature length is 584.0 base pairs (4.67% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 22,965.5 base pairs (55.46% of all genes).


The gene RP1 (NCBI ID: 6101) has been mentioned in [90 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22RP1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1961 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2003 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning RP1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Relationship of group P1 plasmids revealed by heteroduplex experiments: RP1, RP4, R68 and RK2 are identical.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/120408)" (1979) (relative citation ratio: 5.14), "[Linkage mapping of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP1) to the pericentric region of human chromosome 8.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1783394)" (1991) (relative citation ratio: 3.37), "[KLF5 regulated lncRNA RP1 promotes the growth and metastasis of breast cancer via repressing p27kip1 translation.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31073122)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 2.9), "[Isolation of a temperature-sensitive derivative of RP1.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6100900)" (1980) (relative citation ratio: 2.71), and "[Ginsenoside Rp1, a Ginsenoside Derivative, Blocks Promoter Activation of iNOS and COX-2 Genes by Suppression of an IKKβ-mediated NF-кB Pathway in HEK293 Cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23717062)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 2.26). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0.

[RP1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000104237-RP1) is a gene with evidence at the protein level, known for its involvement in Retinitis pigmentosa. It is detected in some RNA tissue distributions and is primarily located in the mid piece of cells. The gene is highly expressed in the retina, playing a crucial role in visual perception, and is also expressed in the brainstem. Additionally, RP1 is found in photoreceptor cells and is associated with lymphoma cell lines.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [NR3C1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2908), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170), [MBL2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4153), and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), each shown to be regulating in 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the fallopian tube and lung, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the ciliary ganglion, skin, and ovary.
