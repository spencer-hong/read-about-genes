[PTPRK](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000152894-PTPRK) is a gene with molecular functions as a hydrolase, protein phosphatase, and receptor. It is involved in cancer-related genes and has evidence at the protein level. The gene is detected in many tissues and is localized in vesicles, the plasma membrane, cell junctions, the connecting piece, and the flagellar centriole. PTPRK is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 18 for non-specific translation in blood, Cluster 45 for intestine-related digestion in tissues, Cluster 11 for white matter signal transduction in the brain, Cluster 53 for squamous epithelial cells keratinization in cell lines, and Cluster 34 for neuronal signaling in single cells.

PTPRK has been associated with various traits through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Educational attainment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35361970), which maps closely to the MeSH term [Educational Status](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004522) via a synonym direct match. Additionally, PTPRK is associated with [Verbal short term memory](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35974141), which aligns with the MeSH term [Memory](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D008568) through an embedding match using [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0).


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the bladder and stomach, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Prefrontal Cortex, Fetal brain, Occipital Lobe, Bronchial Epithelial Cells, and Fetal lung.
