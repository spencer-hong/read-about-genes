The top 5 publications mentioning S100A4, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Single-cell analysis of human glioma and immune cells identifies S100A4 as an immunotherapy target.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35140215)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 14.96), "[S100A4 and metastasis: a small actor playing many roles.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20019188)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 8.55), "[Plasma-activated medium induces ferroptosis by depleting FSP1 in human lung cancer cells.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35256587)" (2022) (relative citation ratio: 7.78), "[Cancer-associated fibroblast compositions change with breast cancer progression linking the ratio of S100A4<sup>+</sup> and PDPN<sup>+</sup> CAFs to clinical outcome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35122040)" (2020) (relative citation ratio: 7.35), and "[Fibroblast-specific protein 1 identifies an inflammatory subpopulation of macrophages in the liver.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21173249)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 6.4). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[S100A4](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000196154-S100A4) is a cancer-related gene with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily localized in the nucleoplasm and cytosol. The gene is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils, particularly in the degranulation process, and is also found in adipose tissue with mixed functions. In the brain, it is associated with non-specific vasculature, and in cell lines, it is linked to squamous epithelial cells involved in keratinization. Single-cell expression data indicate its role in monocytes related to the innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 6 experiments, [MBD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8930) with 5 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 5 experiments, [FOXA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3170) with 5 experiments, and [ERG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2078) with 4 experiments.





The gene is expressed in various blood-related cell types and tissues, including CD33+ myeloid cells, CD14+ monocytes, and whole blood. Additionally, expression is noted in CD105+ endothelial cells.
