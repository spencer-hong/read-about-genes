The gene is located in the [extracellular region](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005576), [cytoplasm](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005737), [endoplasmic reticulum](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005783), [Golgi apparatus](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005794), [dendrite](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030425), [synaptic cleft](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043083), [axon initial segment](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0043194), and [glutamatergic synapse](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0098978). It is active in the [extracellular space](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005615) and enables [signaling receptor binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005102) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). The gene is involved in various processes including [nervous system development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007399), [axon guidance](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007411), [positive regulation of cell growth](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0030307), [neuron projection development](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031175), [positive regulation of synaptic transmission](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0050806), and [neurotransmitter receptor localization to postsynaptic specialization membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0099645).


The gene length is 41,236 base pairs (61.12% of all genes), the mature length is 2,599 base pairs (65.83% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 41,197 base pairs (70.75% of all genes).


The gene LGI1 (NCBI ID: 9211) has been mentioned in [319 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22LGI1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1998 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2013 and 2020. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning LGI1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Antibodies to Kv1 potassium channel-complex proteins leucine-rich, glioma inactivated 1 protein and contactin-associated protein-2 in limbic encephalitis, Morvan's syndrome and acquired neuromyotonia.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20663977)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 25.89), "[Investigation of LGI1 as the antigen in limbic encephalitis previously attributed to potassium channels: a case series.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20580615)" (2010) (relative citation ratio: 19.93), "[Faciobrachial dystonic seizures precede Lgi1 antibody limbic encephalitis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21416487)" (2011) (relative citation ratio: 19.06), "[Anti-LGI1 encephalitis: Clinical syndrome and long-term follow-up.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27590293)" (2016) (relative citation ratio: 16.02), and "[Evaluation of seizure treatment in anti-LGI1, anti-NMDAR, and anti-GABA<sub>B</sub>R encephalitis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30979857)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 11.36). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[LGI1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000108231-LGI1) is a gene involved in cancer-related processes, disease variants, and epilepsy, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. The gene is detected in some RNA tissue distributions and is notably expressed in the choroid plexus, where it is associated with transmembrane transport. In the brain, LGI1 is found in the choroid plexus with mixed functions. Additionally, it is expressed in breast cancer cell lines and astrocytes, although its function in these contexts is not well understood. The gene has been found to be unprognostic in certain cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and testicular germ cell tumors.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [AR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/367) with 4 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, [SMARCA4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6597) with 3 experiments, [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599) with 3 experiments, and [GATA2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2624) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including coronary artery disease, artery disease, vascular disease, cardiovascular system disease, kidney disease, urinary system disease, nervous system disease, central nervous system disease, neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, tauopathy, dementia, cognitive disorder, disease of mental health, and peripheral vascular disease.



The gene is ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissue samples, including nerve, brain, and pituitary, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in various brain regions such as the Prefrontal Cortex, Amygdala, Fetal brain, Caudate nucleus, Hypothalamus, Thalamus, and Cingulate Cortex.
