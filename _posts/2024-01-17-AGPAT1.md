The gene is involved in the [positive regulation of cytokine production](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001819) and the [positive regulation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathway](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0001961). It enables [1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase activity](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003841) and [protein binding](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005515). The gene is active in and located in the [endoplasmic reticulum](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005783) and its membrane, as well as the [membrane](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020). Additionally, it is involved in the [phospholipid metabolic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006644), [phosphatidic acid biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006654), and the [CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthetic process](https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016024).


The gene length is 34,697.0 base pairs (56.67% of all genes), the mature length is 771.5 base pairs, and the primary transcript length is 31,790.5 base pairs.


The gene AGPAT1 (NCBI ID: 10554) has been mentioned in [19 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22AGPAT1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1988 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2005 and 2018. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning AGPAT1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Long noncoding RNA OIP5-AS1 causes cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma through inducing the LPAATβ/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by sponging the miR-340-5p.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30548308)" (2019) (relative citation ratio: 5.23), "[Phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes in Alzheimer's disease: increased lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity and decreased phospholipase A2 activity.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9453575)" (1998) (relative citation ratio: 2.64), "[MicroRNA-24 inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo by targeting LPAATβ.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23578572)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 1.95), "[Circular RNA circ-CHI3L1.2 modulates cisplatin resistance of osteosarcoma cells via the miR-340-5p/LPAATβ axis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34164774)" (2021) (relative citation ratio: 1.56), and "[MicroRNA-340-5p modulates cisplatin resistance by targeting LPAATβ in osteosarcoma.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28443990)" (2017) (relative citation ratio: 1.53). The relative citation ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[AGPAT1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000204310-AGPAT1) is an acyltransferase and transferase with evidence at the protein level. It is detected in many tissues and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and rods & rings. AGPAT1 is part of Cluster 29 in blood expression, indicating non-specific and unknown function, and Cluster 66 in tissue expression, suggesting involvement in transcription. In the brain, it is part of Cluster 1, associated with neurons and mixed function. Additionally, AGPAT1 is found in Cluster 28 in cell line expression, linked to nuclear processes, and Cluster 22 in single-cell expression, associated with proximal enterocytes and digestion.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from GTRD's database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [TBP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6908), [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664), [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), and [SMARCC1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6599), each shown to be regulating in 5 experiments.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including infectious diseases such as viral infections and hepatitis B, immune system disorders, metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus (both type 1 and type 2), obesity, and cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease. Additionally, the data highlights links to neurodegenerative diseases, arthritis, retinal degeneration, age-related macular degeneration, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease, and vitiligo.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including nerve, ovary, and uterus, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in the Prefrontal Cortex, Leukemia (chronic Myelogenous K-562), Thalamus, Atrioventricular Node, Testis Leydig Cell, and Testis Germ Cell.


The proteins are involved in various metabolic processes, including the activation of metabolic gene expression by ChREBP, triglyceride biosynthesis, and the metabolism of fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and ketone bodies. Additionally, they participate in broader metabolic pathways such as lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, energy metabolism integration, and the synthesis of phosphatidic acid (PA). Furthermore, these proteins play roles in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis and phospholipid metabolism.


The mouse ortholog gene 55979 and its human ortholog gene 10554 are associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include decreased circulating calcium levels, increased circulating alkaline phosphatase levels, increased urine microalbumin levels, and preweaning lethality with incomplete penetrance. All these phenotypes are observed in both sexes.
