The gene length is 180,659 base pairs (91.36% of all genes), the mature length is 3,562 base pairs (79.38% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 98,336 base pairs (88.0% of all genes).


The gene FXR1 (NCBI ID: 8087) has been mentioned in [58 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22FXR1%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1995 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2007 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning FXR1, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[AU-rich-element-mediated upregulation of translation by FXR1 and Argonaute 2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17382880)" (2007) (relative citation ratio: 9.31), "[The fragile X mental retardation syndrome protein interacts with novel homologs FXR1 and FXR2.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7489725)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 4.87), "[A highly conserved protein family interacting with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and displaying selective interactions with FMRP-related proteins FXR1P and FXR2P.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11438699)" (2001) (relative citation ratio: 4.39), "[FXR1, an autosomal homolog of the fragile X mental retardation gene.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7781595)" (1995) (relative citation ratio: 3.67), and "[Differential expression of FMR1, FXR1 and FXR2 proteins in human brain and testis.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9259278)" (1997) (relative citation ratio: 2.96). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[FXR1](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000114416-FXR1) is a developmental protein with RNA-binding molecular function, supported by evidence at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and primarily localized in the cytosol. FXR1 is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 42 for non-specific vesicular transport in blood, Cluster 2 for skeletal muscle and striated muscle contraction in tissues, Cluster 28 for oligodendrocytes with mixed function in the brain, Cluster 63 for non-specific protein processing in cell lines, and Cluster 36 for late spermatids with unknown function in single cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [IKZF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10320) with 5 experiments, [KMT2A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297) with 4 experiments, [CTCF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10664) with 4 experiments, [PGR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5241) with 4 experiments, and [TRPS1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7227) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of conditions, including diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, nutrition diseases, overnutrition, obesity, cognitive disorders, diseases of mental health, psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, gastrointestinal system diseases, and gallbladder diseases.



The gene is expressed in various tissues, including muscle, ovary, and adrenal gland, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Skeletal Muscle, Testis Interstitial, Testis Leydig Cell, Testis Seminiferous Tubule, and Testis Germ Cell.
