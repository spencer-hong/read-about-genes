[GYPC](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000136732-GYPC) is a gene that functions as a blood group antigen, with evidence supporting its role at the protein level. It is detected in all tissues and is primarily located in the plasma membrane. The gene is expressed in various clusters, including Cluster 43 for non-specific transcription and translation in blood, Cluster 56 for unknown function in tissues, Cluster 20 for immune response in the brain, Cluster 9 for melanin biosynthesis in skin cancer cell lines, and Cluster 1 for oxygen transport in erythroid cells.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) with 5 experiments, [YY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7528) with 4 experiments, [NFKB1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4790) with 4 experiments, [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476) with 4 experiments, and [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 4 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [4602](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4602) and [4149](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149). These TFs were shown to be regulating genes in 1 and 3 Perturb-seq experiments, respectively.


The GWAS data indicates associations with a range of disease conditions, including hematopoietic system disease, immune system disease, diseases of metabolism, acquired metabolic diseases, carbohydrate metabolism diseases, glucose metabolism diseases, diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, nutrition diseases, overnutrition, obesity, cardiovascular system diseases, heart diseases, bone diseases, connective tissue diseases, musculoskeletal system diseases, bone remodeling diseases, bone resorption diseases, anemia, congenital hemolytic anemia, hemolytic anemia, normocytic anemia, and hemoglobinopathies.


The GYPC gene has been associated with several traits and diseases through genome-wide association studies. Notably, it has been linked to [Hemoglobin A1c levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34594039) and [Hemoglobin levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327693), both of which map to the MeSH term [Hemoglobins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D006454) using the [BioWordVec](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0055-0) method. Additionally, GYPC is associated with [High light scatter reticulocyte count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), which maps to the MeSH term [Reticulocytes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012156), and [Reticulocyte count](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), which directly matches the canonical name 'Reticulocyte Count' with the MeSH term [Reticulocyte Count](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D017701). Furthermore, it is linked to [High light scatter reticulocyte percentage of red cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), mapping to the MeSH term [Cells](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D002477), and [Reticulocyte fraction of red cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32888494), which also maps to [Reticulocytes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D012156).


The gene is expressed in adipose tissue and blood. Additionally, it is expressed in various tissues and cell types including leukemia (chronic myelogenous K-562), CD105+ endothelial cells, CD71+ early erythroid cells, bone marrow, fetal liver, and skeletal muscle.
