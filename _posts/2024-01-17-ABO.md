The [ABO](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000175164-ABO) gene, with evidence at the transcript level, is detected in many tissues. It is associated with Cluster 20 in blood expression, which is non-specific for DNA binding, and Cluster 45 in tissue expression, which is specific to the intestine and digestion. In brain expression, it falls under Cluster 31, which is non-specific for transcription. Additionally, the gene is linked to Cluster 53 in cell line expression, specific to squamous epithelial cells and keratinization, and Cluster 22 in single cell expression, specific to proximal enterocytes and digestion.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SUZ12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23512) and [MYC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609), each with 5 experiments. Additionally, [RUNX1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/861), [BRD4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23476), and [EZH2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2146) were each found to be regulating in 4 experiments.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a wide range of disease conditions, including various types of cancer such as gastrointestinal system cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and hematologic cancer. Infectious diseases, particularly those caused by viral agents like human immunodeficiency virus, are also represented. Metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus, specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity, are notable. Cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, are included, along with kidney disease and urinary system disease. Additionally, the data encompasses liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and fatty liver disease, as well as endocrine system diseases like Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism.

The data further includes conditions like sarcoidosis, cerebrovascular disease, and various types of cancer affecting different organ systems, including pancreatic cancer and esophageal cancer.


Genome-wide association studies have identified several traits and diseases associated with the ABO blood group system. Notably, [Alanine aminotransferase levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484) were mapped to [Transaminases](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000637) using BioWordVec. Additionally, [Angiopoietin-1 receptor levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33067605) and [Angiopoietin-1 receptor, soluble levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34814699) were both mapped to [Angiopoietin-1](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D042683). [Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354) were associated with [Enzymes](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004798), and [Apolipoprotein B levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33462484) with [Apolipoproteins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D001053).

Other notable associations include [Cadherin-17 levels](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648354) with [Cadherins](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D015820), [Duodenal ulcer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38036781) with [Duodenal Ulcer](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D004381), and [End-stage coagulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23381943) with [Thromboinflammation](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000090882). These findings highlight the diverse biological roles and clinical implications of the ABO blood group system.


The gene is expressed in various tissues, including cardiac myocytes, heart, liver, colorectal adenocarcinoma, colon, adrenal gland, and fetal liver. Additionally, it is expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji) cells.



The mouse ortholog gene 80908, which corresponds to the human ortholog gene 28, is associated with several phenotypic abnormalities. These include abnormal skin morphology, which is observed in both sexes, as well as abnormal testis morphology and small testis, both of which are not observed in both sexes.
