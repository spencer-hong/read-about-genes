The gene CD80, with NCBI ID 941, has been mentioned in [426 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22CD80%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727). The earliest year of publication mentioning CD80 is 1982, and the middle 50% of publications occurred between 1997 and 2013. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top 5 publications mentioning CD80, ranked by their scientific influence, include "[Costimulation of T lymphocytes: the role of CD28, CTLA-4, and B7/BB1 in interleukin-2 production and immunotherapy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1335362)" (1992) (relative citation ratio: 25.58), "[Human B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) bind with similar avidities but distinct kinetics to CD28 and CTLA-4 receptors.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7534620)" (1994) (relative citation ratio: 14.43), "[Activated T cells induce expression of B7/BB1 on normal or leukemic B cells through a CD40-dependent signal.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7681471)" (1993) (relative citation ratio: 10.41), "[Abatacept in B7-1-positive proteinuric kidney disease.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24206430)" (2013) (relative citation ratio: 9.22), and "[Induction of B7-1 in podocytes is associated with nephrotic syndrome.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15146236)" (2004) (relative citation ratio: 9.21). The [Relative Citation Ratio (RCR)](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Citation counts are sourced from [iCite](https://icite.od.nih.gov).


[CD80](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000121594-CD80) functions as a host cell receptor for virus entry and is an FDA-approved drug target. Evidence for its function is available at the protein level. CD80 is detected in some tissues and is associated with lymphoid tissue, specifically in cytokine signaling. In the brain, it is linked to immune cells involved in the immune response. CD80 is also expressed in lymphoma cell lines and Langerhans cells, where it plays a role in the innate immune response.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688) with 4 experiments, [DPF2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5977) with 3 experiments, [ESR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2099) with 3 experiments, [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033) with 3 experiments, and [SMC3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9126) with 3 experiments. These TFs have been shown to play significant roles in gene regulation, as evidenced by their frequent appearance in CHIP-seq data.



The input data from GWAS indicates associations with a variety of disease conditions, including breast cancer, thoracic cancer, lung cancer, respiratory system cancer, immune system disease, disease of metabolism, acquired metabolic disease, carbohydrate metabolism disease, glucose metabolism disease, diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disease, musculoskeletal system disease, lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus, hypersensitivity reaction disease, hypersensitivity reaction type II disease, B cell deficiency, primary immunodeficiency disease, dysgammaglobulinemia, selective immunoglobulin deficiency disease, and selective IgE deficiency disease.



The gene is expressed in multiple tissue samples, including lung, blood, and spleen, as indicated by the BioGPS Human Cell Type and Tissue Gene Expression Profiles. Additionally, the GTEx Tissue Gene Expression Profiles show expression in Cardiac Myocytes, Burkitt's Lymphoma (Raji), Liver, 721 B Lymphoblasts, Superior Cervical Ganglion, and Trigeminal Ganglion.


The input data highlights various pathways involved in immune system function and signaling, including adaptive and innate immune systems. Key pathways include PI3K/AKT signaling in cancer, with specific events in ERBB2 and ERBB4 signaling, as well as the PI-3K cascade. Additionally, the data covers signaling by multiple receptors such as SCF-KIT, ERBB4, PDGF, FGFR, and EGFR, including their roles in cancer. Other notable pathways include DAP12 interactions and signaling, downstream signal transduction, and signaling by the B Cell Receptor (BCR) and Fc epsilon receptor (FCERI). The data also encompasses CD28 co-stimulation and its dependent pathways, as well as CTLA4 inhibitory signaling.
