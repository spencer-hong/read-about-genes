The gene length is 177,657 base pairs (91.13% of all genes), the mature length is 432 base pairs (0.87% of all genes), and the primary transcript length is 67,040 base pairs (81.58% of all genes).


The gene LAMP2, with NCBI ID 3920, has been featured in [150 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%22LAMP2%22) according to [Pubtator](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W587/5494727), with the earliest publication in 1988 and the middle 50% of publications occurring between 2008 and 2019. Note that the publication count in the hyperlink may be different since the count is from Pubtator.


The top five publications mentioning LAMP2, ranked by their scientific influence, include studies that explore the gene's role in various biological processes. The Relative Citation Ratio ([RCR](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002541)) measures the scientific influence of each paper by field- and time-adjusting the citations it has received, benchmarking to the median for NIH publications, which is set at 1.0. Notable works include "[Accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and cardiomyopathy in LAMP-2-deficient mice.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10972293)" (2000) (relative citation ratio: 12.71), "[Roles of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 in lysosome biogenesis and autophagy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16973206)" (2006) (relative citation ratio: 12.34), "[Clinical outcome and phenotypic expression in LAMP2 cardiomyopathy.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19318653)" (2009) (relative citation ratio: 5.87), "[Transcription factor NFE2L2/NRF2 modulates chaperone-mediated autophagy through the regulation of LAMP2A.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29950142)" (2018) (relative citation ratio: 5.75), and "[Chronic acidosis in the tumour microenvironment selects for overexpression of LAMP2 in the plasma membrane.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26658462)" (2015) (relative citation ratio: 4.2).

The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, based on the number of CHIP-seq experiments, include [SPI1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6688), [EP300](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2033), and [MAX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4149), each with 3 experiments. Additionally, [KLF4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9314) and [ATF3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/467) were found to be regulating in 2 experiments each.


The top transcription factors (TFs) identified from the GTRD database of TF binding sites, filtered for Perturb-seq data, include [GATA1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6829), [NFE2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8243), [KLF1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8861), and [ZNF263](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9968). Each of these TFs, except for ZNF263, was shown to regulate gene expression in one Perturb-seq experiment, while ZNF263 was found to regulate gene expression in two experiments.








The analyzed protein sequence has a GRAVY value of -0.044 (81.73rd percentile), indicating a hydrophilic nature. The charge at pH 7.0 is -8.874 (24.57th percentile), and the median structural flexibility is 0.997 (26.83rd percentile).
